Pan-Seared Scallops with Prosecco Butter Sauce,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Pan-Seared Scallops with Prosecco Butter Sauce,4 servings,2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil 1- 1/2 pounds sea scallops tough ligament removed from the side  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil if needed 1 small shallot minced 1 medium garlic clove minced 1 cup Prosecco   3/4 cup whipping cream 3 tablespoons unsalted butter cut into small pieces 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons chopped chives   ,These succulent scallops are perfectly accompanied with sweet yet slightly acidic Prosecco in a delicate buttery sauce. For even cooking with a crisp exterior it is suggested that the exterior of the scallops are patted dry prior to cooking seasoned and allowed to reach room temperature before being placed into a hot pan.   Remove the scallops from the refrigerator and season with salt and pepper. Allow to reach room temperature.  To cook scallops: Place a large non-stick skillet over a high heat;  add canola oil and heat until the oil starts to shimmer. Carefully add the seasoned scallops to the skillet sear until browned on both sides and just opaque in the center-about 2 to 3 minutes per side depending on the size. Using tongs transfer the scallops to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.  To prepare the sauce: Return the skillet to the stove over a moderate heat and add the olive oil if the pan is dry. When the oil is shimmering add the shallots and cook until tender about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant about 1 minute. Add the Prosecco; bring the liquid to a boil and cook scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a silicone spatula. Pour in the cream and continue to cook until the mixture has thickened about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the butter a little at a time.  Stir in the lemon juice and chives taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   To serve: Divide the scallops between 4 warmed serving plates ladle the sauce over the top and serve immediately.

Try different cheeses and flavorings and you will have a whole new hors d'oeuvre. Or split the baked puffs in half and fill them with crab or lobster salad or any filling you like. They aren't as flashy as some art-directed appetizers but they always disappear first at a party.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and position two racks in the top and lower thirds of the oven. Line the baking sheets with parchment paper.  In the bowl of the stand mixer combine the dough  3/4 cup of the cheese the mustard and black pepper. Mix on low just until evenly blended.  Spoon 1-inch rounds of the dough onto the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart. In a small bowl lightly beat the egg to blend thoroughly. Brush a light coating of egg over the tops of the rounds being careful that it does not drip down the sides (it will glue the dough to the parchment). You will not use all the egg. Sprinkle each round with a little of the remaining  3/4 cup cheese.  Bake the gougeres for 20 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F switch the sheets between the racks rotate each pan from front to back and bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer until the gougeres are a deep golden brown and no bubbling moisture is visible around the sides of each shape. Transfer to a rack to cool briefly. Serve the gougeres warm piled on a platter for guests to help themselves.  Storing: Baked gougeres may be stored airtight at room temperature for up to 3 days. Before serving warm and crisp them for 7 to 9 minutes in a 375 degrees F oven until the outside crust is crisp and the interior is heated through.   
Spent Coffee Short Rib Chili,Recipe courtesy of Scraps,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Spent Coffee Short Rib Chili,6 servings  Learn more about Scraps ,1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 2  1/2 pounds boneless beef short ribs Coarse sea salt 3 medium yellow onions peeled and chopped 2 tablespoons chili powder 2 tablespoons ground cumin 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 1 star anise  1/2 cup brandy 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes 2 tablespoons spent coffee grounds 1 quart chicken stock homemade or bought 1  1/2 cups French brown lentils 1 cup packaged fried shallots (get them at any Asian grocery or online)  2 cups shredded sharp white cheddar cheese   ,Imagine how many cups of coffee are brewed every single morning and every one of those cups results in a couple of tablespoons of used coffee grounds. The aroma of coffee is intoxicating and it’s still there even after the beans are spent. I love their roasted chocolate notes with assertive red meats like the short ribs in this chili.   Get the oil hot in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the short ribs with a good amount of salt. Brown the meat on all sides for about 3 minutes per side. Don’t crowd the pot. If the pieces of meat touch they will steam and not brown. Remove them and continue browning the rest of the short ribs. Remove onto the pot lid turned upside down to catch the juices.  Add the onions to the Dutch oven and cook until they start to brown about 5 minutes. Stir when it looks like they could use stirring.  Stir in the ground spices brown sugar and star anise and cook until the smell of the spices is strong a minute or so.  Add the brandy. Stand back as the brandy could flame. If it does cover with a lid to douse the flames. Another lid not the one holding the short ribs. Cook until the pot is almost dry. Add the tomatoes with their juices. Add the spent coffee grounds stock short ribs and any accumulated juices. Cover and simmer over low heat until the meat is fork-tender about 2 1/2 hours.  Stir in the lentils and continue to simmer covered until the lentils are tender about 30 minutes.  Remove the short ribs from the chili. Using two forks shred the meat into bite-size pieces. Stir back into the chili. Serve garnished with the fried shallots and cheese.

Although nearly any frosting pairs well with this celebration favorite it is especially luscious filled and frosted with silken chocolate ganache for the two-toned birthday cake most of us remember from childhood. For a special party or tea make the mini cupcakes variation at the end of the recipe (shown at left) then top them with swirls of Cream Cheese Frosting and finish them with pretty Sugared Flowers and/or touches of gold leaf.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat the pan with melted butter oil or high-heat canola-oil spray and fit it with a round of parchment paper.  Cream the butter with the sugar: Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer and beat on medium until very light-almost white-in color 4 to 5 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl although you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape down the bowl with the spatula.  Add the eggs: Beat the eggs and vanilla in the small bowl to blend. With the mixer on medium add the eggs to the butter mixture about 1 tablespoon at a time allowing each addition to completely blend in before adding the next. About halfway through turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl then resume adding the eggs. Scrape down the bowl again.  Add the dry and wet ingredients alternately: With the fine-mesh strainer sift the cake flour baking soda and salt into the medium bowl and whisk together. With the mixer on the lowest speed add the flour mixture and the sour cream alternately beginning with one-third of the flour mixture and half the sour cream; repeat then finish with flour mixture. Scrape down the bowl and finish blending the batter by hand if necessary.  Bake the cake: Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.  Unmold the cake: Run the thin and flexible knife or spatula around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake. Place the cardboard on top of the pan hold both together and flip over. Remove the pan leaving the parchment on the cake. Flip again onto a second cake cardboard (or a plate) so the cake is right side up. Level the cake if necessary. Using a serrated knife slice the cake horizontally into two layers.  Assemble and frost the cake: Place the cake cardboard (or plate) on your work surface. Flip the top layer of cake over and place it cut side up on the cardboard-this will be the bottom of the cake. With the icing spatula spread 1 cup of ganache evenly over the surface of the cake all the way to the edge. Flip the bottom layer and slide it cut side down into place on top of the ganache. Peel off the parchment paper. Voil&agrave;-a crumb-free surface for frosting. Spread a very thin layer of the frosting known as a crumb coat over the cake. Chill for 15 minutes just to set the crumb coat. Use the remaining ganache to frost the top and side of the cake. Use a spoon to create swirls all over the top by gently pressing the tip of the spoon rounded edge down into the frosting in a back-and-forth motion.   To serve: slice the cake with a thin and sharp knife.  Storing: The cake can be stored at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigeratorf r up to 4 days. Be sure to remove it from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving toal ow the cake and frosting to soften to the perfect eating consistency.

In a small saucepan heat rhubarb  3/4 cup sugar and 4 tablespoons water over medium heat. Cook until the rhubarb falls apart adding water by the tablespoon if the rhubarb sticks to the bottom of the pan. At this point either use an immersion blender to puree the mixture or (if you're like me and your blender is otherwise occupied) push the mixture through a strainer-the first method is definitely easier.  Put a couple inches of water into the pot of a double boiler and set it over medium heat. Put the egg yolks the remaining  1/3 cup plus  1/8 cup sugar the butter lemon zest and lemon juice in the bowl of the double boiler and whisk to combine. When the sugar has dissolved completely mix in the warm rhubarb puree by the spoonful to temper the eggs. When all the rhubarb has been mixed in set the bowl over the pot; the water should be simmering. Stir for about 5 minutes until warm and slightly thickened. Remove from the heat. Press through a fine-mesh strainer-this will give your curd that smooth pudding-like texture-into a jar or other container with lid. Once cooled the curd will keep in the fridge for up to a week.

Fresh Pasta Dough,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/breads/dough/Fresh Pasta Dough,4 servings,2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) "00" flour plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt 4 large eggs 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil    , Fresh pasta dough is so easy to make you'll wonder why you never did before. If you can find Italian "00" flour use it to make very delicate yet chewy pasta. If not bread flour works really well.   To make dough: Place flour and salt in a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Make a "well" in the center of the flour mixture and add eggs and oil. Using your fingers blend the eggs into the flour mixture stirring the flour in from the sides of the well and working outwards. When the pasta dough is thoroughly mixed turn it out on a lightly floured work surface. Knead dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky adding small amounts of flour as needed; about 5 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest for at least 20 minutes or up to an hour at room temperature.  To roll dough: Secure a pasta machine to the edge of a long countertop. Using a bench scraper cut the dough into three pieces. Keep extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with one piece. With a rolling pin roll the piece of dough into a rough rectangle so that it will fit inside the widest setting of the pasta machine. Roll the dough through the machine catching it with one hand as you roll with the other. Take the dough and trifold it like a letter. Turn the dough so one open end faces the machine and roll it through on the widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting.   Continue rolling the pasta through the machine without folding adjusting the rollers to a smaller setting each time until the desired thickness is reached. If the pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.  Cut sheets to desired shapes and sizes toss with semolina flour and set aside covered with a clean kitchen towel. The pasta can be cooked immediately or covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use.   To cook pasta: Heat a large pot of water over high heat until boiling. Generously season water with salt. Add pasta and stir immediately to prevent the strands from sticking together. Boil until al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve about a cup of pasta water and drain pasta through a colander. Toss hot pasta with your sauce of choice using reserved pasta water to thin the mixture and coat the pasta as needed. Garnish as desired and serve immediately.

Chocolate Banana Marble Bread,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Chocolate Banana Marble Bread,1 loaf,2 large or 3 medium very ripe bananas at room temperature  3/4 cup (2 ounces) buttermilk at room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 cups (7 ounces) sifted cake flour 1 teaspoon baking soda  3/4 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 cup (1 ounce) unsifted unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) boiling water plus more if needed 1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter softened (65 degrees  to 68 degrees F) 1 cup (7 ounces) sugar 2 large eggs at room temperature lightly beaten   ,Here's a banana bread that's soft tender and bursting with bananas yet not overly sweet as so many versions are. The key is an intensely bitter cocoa-powder paste added to half of the batter resulting in a deep rich chocolate flavor that pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the bananas. The two batters are marbled together producing a beautiful pattern and adding a sophisticated note to this all-American favorite. Because of the moisture that the bananas add the loaf keeps well for at least 4 to 5 days at room temperature and it freezes so well that you can put a couple of them away for unexpected visitors. Be sure the bananas are ripe and soft with plenty of black spots speckling their skins or you won't have the burst of banana flavor you want. Whirl them in the food processor for an ultra-smooth puree or mash thoroughly with a fork if you prefer.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat the loaf pan with melted butter or high-heat canola oil spray and line it with a piece of parchment paper that extends 1 inch beyond the long edge of both sides of the pan. Peel the bananas and place them in the bowl of the food processor. Process to a smooth puree. (Alternately mash them in a bowl using a fork.) Measure out 1 cup of the puree and transfer it to a medium bowl discarding the rest of the puree or saving it for another use. Add the buttermilk and vanilla and whisk just until blended. Set aside.  Use a fine-mesh strainer to sift the cake flour baking soda and baking powder together into a medium bowl. Whisk to blend well. Set aside. Place the cocoa powder in the small bowl. Pour the boiling water over the cocoa and stir until it forms a smooth paste-it should run thickly off the spoon. If it is too thick add another tablespoon of boiling water and stir again. Set aside.  Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer. Beat on medium-high speed until the butter is very light almost white in color 4 to 5 minutes. Scrape down the bowl with a spatula. Turn the mixer to medium speed and add the eggs 1 tablespoon at a time completely blending in each addition before adding the next. About halfway through the eggs turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl with the spatula then continue adding the rest of the eggs. Scrape down the bowl again.  With the mixer running on the lowest speed add one-third of the flour mixture. Just as it is barely blended and you can still see a few patches of flour add half the banana mixture. Repeat with the remaining flour and banana mixtures ending with the flour. Scrape down the bowl and finish blending the batter by hand.  Transfer half of the batter to the second medium bowl. Add the cocoa paste and using the rubber spatula gently but thoroughly blend it into the batter.  Drop alternating spoonfuls of dark and light batters into the prepared pan then marbleize by using a spoon to gently turn the batter over in 3 places down the length of the pan.  Bake the banana bread for 55 to 65 minutes until firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. When cool remove from the pan peel off the parchment paper and cut slices by sawing gently with a serrated knife.

In Brittany the crepes are made with buckwheat flour and the typical filling is a smear of salted butter cheese ham or bacon thinly sliced fruit and/or eggs. In most of France crepes are rolled up or folded into half or quarter circles but in Brittany where they are sometimes called galettes they are folded differently. The filling is spread in the center of the pancake the four rounded sides are folded in over the filling forming a square and then the crepe is inverted onto a serving plate.  Make the crepe batter: in a large bowl stir together the buckwheat flour all-purpose flour and salt. in a small bowl whisk the eggs until well blended; stir in the water and butter. Gradually whisk the egg mixture into the flour mixture until the batter is smooth. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream. If it is too thick whisk in additional water 1 tablespoon at a time.  While the batter is resting prepare the filling: in a large skillet melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the onions increase the heat to medium and cook stirring for 5 minutes. Add the apples and cook stirring for 10 to 15 minutes until the apples begin to brown and have softened. Add the ham and sprinkle with the lemon juice nutmeg and salt. Cover and set aside until ready to fill the crepes.  Heat a 9- to 11-inch crepe pan over medium-low heat until hot enough for a drop of water to sizzle on contact. Brush the surface of the crepe pan with a thin film of the melted butter. Blot any excess with the tip of a paper towel. Stir the crepe batter well with the whisk. ladle about  1/3 cup of the batter into the heated pan and simultaneously tilt and roll the pan from side to side to coat the surface with a thin layer of batter. Cook for 1 minute or until the edges begin to set. run the tip of a small narrow rubber spatula under the edges of the crepe to loosen it from the pan. Use your fingertips to lift the crepe and quickly flip it over. Cook the other side for 30 seconds or until the batter is set into a thin pancake. Do not brown the crepe or cook it until crisp. Transfer the crepe to a large round plate. repeat with the remaining batter brushing the pan with more butter if necessary. Stack the crepes as they are made. You should have 12 crepes. if making ahead wrap the crepes in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent drying out. The crepes can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.  If the crepes have been made ahead fill them one at a time by first warming each crepe in the pan over low heat. While they are still in the pan sprinkle about  3/4 cup of the cheese in the center of the crepe. Top the cheese with a large spoonful of the warm apple filling spreading it into a single layer. Fold in two opposite sides of the circle to cover the filling. Then fold in the remaining two rounded sides overlapping slightly to form a square envelope. With a wide spatula lift the crepe from the pan and invert it so it is seam side down onto a serving plate. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm if not serving at once. Fill the remaining crepes in the same way. reserve the remaining filling.  Just before serving brush the smooth top of each crepe with a thin film of the softened butter. reheat the remaining apple filling and spoon a portion on top of each crepe. Serve at once.

Sous Vide Maple-Glazed Carrots with Toasted Pecans and Mint,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Sous Vide Maple-Glazed Carrots with Toasted Pecans and Mint,4 servings,5 medium carrots peeled and sliced into  1/2" thick rounds 1- 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup 1 tablespoon butter 2 tablespoons water 1 teaspoon salt  1/2 cup pecan pieces 1 tablespoon mint leaves cut into thin ribbons   ,Celebrated by chefs from Heston Blumenthal to Thomas Keller cooking sous vide calls for slowly heating vacuum-sealed food in water at low temperatures locking in natural juices and flavors lost with other methods.   The color and flavor of cooking vegetables using sous-vide technology is unparalleled to standard cooking methods. Sous vide cooking allows us to cook at a temperature a bit below the boiling point of water so there is less risk of under/overcooking your vegetables. Furthermore sealing the vegetables before cooking in a water bath helps retain the natural plant sugars which would otherwise be diluted into a large volume of cooking water. That means brighter color and fuller flavor every time.  This recipe was tested with the Sansaire immersion water circulator. Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device's owner's manual for proper food-handling and safety procedures.   Discover more about sous vide cooking with the Sansaire:  Click here »  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange pecan pieces in a single layer. Toast in oven for 5 minutes or until fragrant. Remove from oven and allow to cool.  Choose a pot large enough to hold the carrots with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the pot using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Preheat the water to 185 degrees F. Place carrot rounds in a single layer into a zip lock bag. Add maple syrup butter water and salt. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the pot without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the meat. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag.   Slowly cook until tender 35-40 minutes.   Remove bag with tongs and empty contents of bag into a small skillet. Heat on medium-high heat to reduce the liquid by half tossing carrot rounds to coat. Season with salt and pepper to taste toss with pecan pieces and mint and serve immediately.  Note: The bag of carrots can be cooled in an ice bath and held in the refrigerator until ready to finish.

Nectarine and Raspberry Galette,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Nectarine and Raspberry Galette,8 servings,Galette Dough: 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt  1/2 cup plus 7 tablespoons unsalted butter chilled cut into small pieces About  3/4 cup ice water  Filling: 1 1/2 pounds nectarines halved pitted and sliced lengthwise  1/2 pint raspberries 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 large egg yolk whisked with 1 teaspoon water for egg wash About 1 tablespoon sparkling sugar (coarse decorating sugar)   ,You can adapt this galette to other summer fruits such as apricots plums or berries. In the fall fill it with apples or pears. The beauty of a galette-a tart with a wide rim of dough folded over the fruit-is its rusticity. It should look like a grandmother not a pastry chef made it.  To make the dough: Put the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to blend. Add half the butter and pulse just until the fat is evenly distributed and coated with flour. Add the remaining butter and pulse a few times just until it is coated with flour. There should still be pieces of flour-coated butter about the size of large peas. Transfer the mixture to a bowl.   Drizzle in the ice water while tossing with a fork adding water just until the mixture begins to come together. Gather the dough with your hands and knead gently if necessary to get it to hold together. Resist the temptation to add more water. Handling the dough as little as possible shape it into a thick disk like a hamburger patty then wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. If you have a baking stone put it in the oven on the middle rack to preheat for at least 45 minutes.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 10 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. If it is too cold it will be brittle and difficult to roll. Unwrap the dough and place it between 2 sheets of parchment paper at least 16 inches square. With a rolling pin flatten the dough into a 15-inch circle.   To prevent sticking occasionally lift the top sheet of parchment and lightly flour the dough then replace the parchment and invert the dough so the bottom sheet is on top. Peel back that sheet of parchment and lightly flour the dough then replace the parchment and continue rolling.  When the circle is large enough remove the top sheet of parchment and transfer the dough still on the bottom sheet of parchment to a rimless baking sheet.   To assemble the galette: Working 2 inches from the edge of the dough place the nectarine slices in concentric rings. Scatter the raspberries evenly over the nectarines. Sprinkle the fruit with the granulated sugar.  Using a palette knife or other broad knife to help you lift the dough off the parchment gently fold the uncovered edge of the dough over the fruit to make a wide rough-edged rim. Make sure there are no cracks in the dough for juices to seep through. Brush the rim with the egg wash then sprinkle the rim with the sparkling sugar. With scissors cut off the exposed parchment paper. (It's okay if a little paper is exposed.)  Baking and serving: If you have a baking stone in the oven slide the galette still on the bottom sheet of parchment directly onto the stone. If you do not have a baking stone bake the galette on the rimless baking sheet. Bake until the crust is golden and the nectarines are juicy about 50 minutes. Slide the galette onto a rack to cool slightly. To serve slide it from the rack onto a cutting board and cut into wedges. Serve warm.   
Autumn Leaf Apple-Cranberry Pie,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Autumn Leaf Apple-Cranberry Pie,1 (9- or 10-inch) pie,2 recipes Flaky Pie Dough (recipe attached)  3 3/4 pounds (about 8 medium) crisp-tart apples such as Granny Smith Gala Honeycrisp or Fuji peeled cored and cut into  3/4-inch thick slices 10 ounces fresh cranberries (about 2 1/2 cups) roughly chopped in a food processor    1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar  3/4 cup granulated sugar plus more for dusting crust      1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg  1/8 teaspoon ground allspice  1/8 teaspoon ground cloves   1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt  2 tablespoons cornstarch  1 large egg  1 tablespoon milk  Good-quality vanilla ice cream for serving   ,When choosing baking apples look for firm sturdy apples that will hold their shape in the oven. Otherwise you'll end up with applesauce pie.  Tart Granny Smiths are reliable and available in every market in the country but try seeking out local varieties at the farmers' market or roadside stands during apple season. Don't be afraid to mix and match apples. A few tart and sturdy ones with a few sweet can be a great combination.   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and place a baking sheet on the rack.   To prepare filling: In a large bowl gently toss apples and chopped cranberries with brown sugar granulated sugar lemon juice spices salt and cornstarch until evenly coated. Transfer mixture to a large skillet or Dutch oven. Cook apples over medium-high heat until juices are very thick and apples are crisp-tender about 7 minutes. Remove filling from heat set aside to cool completely. (This filling can be made up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated.)   To prepare pie shell: Lightly flour a work surface. Place one recipe of pastry dough and dust a little flour on top. Roll out the dough into a 14-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Trim the dough so that it overhangs by 1-inch. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.   Lightly flour work surface place the remaining pastry dough in the center and dust a little flour on top. Roll out the dough into a 14-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Use decorative pastry cutters or mini cookie cutters to make 3 or 4 cuts around the center of the dough to form the vents keep the pastry cutouts set aside.    Fill chilled pie shell with the cooled filling. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over the pie dish and carefully unroll the dough to cover the top. Trim the top crust flush with the rim and decoratively crimp the edges. (Chill pie while rolling out any remaining dough scraps to make additional decorative cutouts optional.)     In a small bowl beat the egg with the milk to create an egg wash and use a pastry brush to lightly glaze the surface of the pie. Arrange your decorative cutouts on the top of the pie crust and brush with egg wash. Lightly dust pie with granulated sugar. Bake pie for 60 minutes or until the crust is a lovely golden brown and the apples are bubbling. (Plan on an additional 20 minutes of baking time if the pie filling has been made ahead and refrigerated).  Halfway through baking cover crust with foil or pie crust shield. Transfer pie to a cooling rack and let cool for at least one hour. Serve warm or at room temperature with a scoop of ice cream.   Plan Your Baking Time:  Don't forget that pies have long bake times and often cook at different oven temperatures. Assemble and bake pies the night before or early morning on Thanksgiving Day before your oven is packed with the rest of your holiday dishes. This way the pies have ample time to bake and cool before things really start to heat up in the kitchen.     Getting Ahead: You can make the pie crust 2 days ahead and keep it chilled and covered. You can prepare and cook the apple-cranberry filling up to 3 days in advance.   Storing: The pie will keep at room temperature under a cake dome for up to 2 days. For longer storage cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Reheat in a 375 degrees F oven for 15 to 20 minutes to warm the filling and re-crisp the crust.

Brined Smoked and Grilled Pork Chops with Peach-Bourbon Barbeque Sauce,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Brined Smoked and Grilled Pork Chops with Peach-Bourbon Barbeque Sauce,4 servings,Brine: 4 cups cold water divided  1 cup of ice  1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar  3/4 cup kosher salt  3/4 cup brown sugar 1 tablespoon pickling spice   Pork: 4 bone-in (1- to 1 1/2-inch thick) pork chops 2 tablespoons wood chips Freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil for brushing grill   Peach-Bourbon Barbecue Sauce: *sauce may be made ahead of time 2 pounds peaches 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium sweet onion chopped   3/4 cup seeded and finely chopped jalapeno  2 large garlic cloves minced  3/4 cup light brown sugar  2/3 cup apple cider vinegar  1/3 cup bourbon  3/4 cup honey  3/4 cup tomato paste 1 teaspoon chile powder  1/2 teaspoon dry mustard  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt plus more to taste   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper plus more to taste    , Pork chops take to brine and smoke so well you will never want to eat grilled pork chops any other way. The extra steps require more time but they are so easy you'll agree they make all the difference.  To brine pork: In a small saucepan over medium heat add 1 cup of water and remaining brine ingredients heat until salt and sugar has dissolved. Transfer to a container that can accommodate pork chops and brine add remaining 3 cups water and ice. Stir to cool completely. Add pork chops cover and chill for 4 to 6 hours. (Alternatively use a vacuum sealer or instant marinator to reduce the brining time to 2 hours.)  To smoke pork: Set up stovetop or outdoor smoker according to manufacturers' recommendations. Remove chops from brine and pat dry with paper towels and smoke on medium-low heat for 8 minutes. Remove smoker from heat or turn off and let pork chops stand with the lid closed for an additional 2 minutes.   Preheat a grill or gill pan to medium-high heat. Season pork chops with pepper. Using a silicone brush coat the grates with oil. Grill chops rotating clockwise 30 degrees  after 2 minutes. Once evenly grilled marked turn over and continue to grill about 6 to 8 minutes total depending on thickness or until a digital thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 145 degrees F. Transfer to a cutting board and loosely tent with foil. Rest pork chops for 5 minutes before slicing or serving whole with Peach-Bourbon Barbecue Sauce.  To make peach-bourbon barbeque sauce: Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl and bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Cut an "X" in the bottom of each peach and blanch for about 10 seconds. With a slotted spoon or spider transfer the peaches to ice bath. When cooled peel and coarsely chop.   In a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat add oil. When oil is shimmering add onion and jalapeno.  Cook until tender using a wooden spoon to stir occasionally about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the peaches and remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.  Cook uncovered stirring occasionally until sauce has thickened and flavors meld about 20 minutes. Using a hand blender puree sauce smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Cool barbeque sauce and transfer to an airtight container. Sauce will last about two weeks refrigerated or can be frozen for longer storage.     
Grilled Pizza with Mozzarella Arugula and Chile Oil,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/main-courses/pizza/Grilled Pizza with Mozzarella Arugula and Chile Oil,2 to 4 servings,Dough:  3/4 cup warm (105 degrees F to 115 degrees F) water 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 tablespoon olive oil plus more for the bowl 1 teaspoon Kosher or sea salt About 1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  Chile Oil: 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 large clove garlic finely minced  3/4 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes Pinch of kosher or sea salt  1/2 teaspoon dried oregano  Other ingredients: Cornmeal for dusting the pizza peel  1/2 pound low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella cheese grated on the large holes of a box grater Large handful of baby arugula   ,Wispy leaves of young arugula are used like an herb in this recipe sprinkled on the sizzling pizza just as it comes off the grill. Note the long slow rise on the dough-a total of six hours-which produces a particularly light chewy and flavorful crust.  To make the dough put the warm water in a bowl and sprinkle the surface with the yeast. Let stand for 2 minutes to soften then whisk with a fork to blend. Let stand until bubbly about 10 minutes. Whisk in the olive oil and salt then begin adding 1 1/2 cups of the flour gradually beating with a wooden spoon until fully incorporated. The dough will be very moist and sticky.  Turn the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and knead with floured hands until smooth and elastic about 5 minutes incorporating as much of the remaining  3/4 cup flour as needed to keep the dough from clinging to your hands or the work surface. The dough will remain moist and a little tacky but should not be sticky. Shape into a ball. Oil a bowl transfer the dough to it and turn the dough to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours.  Punch the dough down. Reshape into a ball re-cover the bowl and let the dough rise again for 4 hours.  If using a charcoal grill prepare a moderate fire. When the coals are ready arrange them in an even layer on one-half of the grill bed.  If using a gas grill preheat all burners to high. About 15 minutes before grilling put a baking stone on the grill rack. The internal temperature of the grill should be 575 degrees F to 600 degrees F.  Punch the dough down turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface and shape into a ball. Dust the surface of the dough with flour cover with a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.  To make the chile oil in a small bowl whisk together the olive oil garlic hot pepper flakes and salt. Add the oregano crumbling it between your fingers as you do and whisk again. Let stand for 30 minutes to blend the flavors.  If you are using a round kettle grill with charcoal you will need to shape the dough into a rectangle so that you can cook the crust first directly over the bed of coals then flip it and finish cooking it over indirect heat. If you are using a gas grill with a baking stone you can shape the dough into a circle because you will not need to flip it.  Dust a pizza peel or rimless baking sheet generously with cornmeal. To prepare the dough for topping you can stretch it with a rolling pin or your hands. Lightly flour a work surface. To use a pin roll out the dough on the floured surface into a 13- to 14-inch circle or into a roughly 16- by 10-inch rectangle depending on your grill. Transfer to the prepared peel. To work by hand flatten the dough into a round then drape the round over the back of your two flour-dusted hands. Form your hands into fists and rotate the dough on your fists. The dough is supple enough that it will stretch with little effort on your part. Stretch into a 13- to 14-inch circle or into a roughly 16- by 10-inch rectangle depending on your grill. Transfer to the prepared pizza peel.  If you are grilling the pizza over charcoal slide the dough off onto the grill rack directly over the coals. Cook uncovered until the dough begins to puff and blister and the bottom becomes nicely browned or even lightly charred in spots 1 to 2 minutes. With tongs or your hands flip the dough over onto the half of the grill with no coals. Working quickly top with the cheese spreading it evenly but leaving a  3/4-inch rim uncovered. Brush the rim with the chile oil then drizzle more of the oil including the garlic and herbs over the pizza reserving a little oil for brushing the pizza rim after grilling. Cover the grill and cook until the pizza rim is well browned and the cheese is melted and bubbling about 5 minutes. Transfer t 
Blood Orange Chicken with Whiskey and Green Olives,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Blood Orange Chicken with Whiskey and Green Olives,4 servings,2 small blood oranges or 1 large Cara Cara or navel orange  3/4 cup smoky Scotch whiskey or Pernod 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard Juice of 1 lemon 2 teaspoons fennel seeds lightly crushed 3 sprigs fresh thyme 1 garlic clove grated on a Microplane or minced 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Pinch of red chile flakes 1 small red onion 1 small fennel bulb trimmed fronds chopped for garnish 1 whole chicken (3 1/2 pounds) cut into 8 pieces and patted dry Extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling  1/2 cup pitted green olives quartered lengthwise  1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar   , A little more involved than the other sheet-pan suppers in this book there are several steps necessary to create this lively pretty Mediterranean-flavored dish-including caramelizing pans of sliced blood oranges marinated chicken and roasted fennel and onion under the broiler in quick succession. It's not at all hard and the layering of flavors-briny olives smoky garlicky meat and juicy-sweet citrus-is worth the extra attention.  Finely grate the zest of one blood orange (or half of a large orange) and place in a large bowl.  Slice the ends off the oranges. Stand each orange up on a cut end and use a paring knife to slice off the peel and pith. Slice oranges crosswise into  3/4-inch-thick rounds and set aside.  Stir the whiskey brown sugar mustard lemon juice fennel seeds thyme sprigs garlic salt pepper and chile flakes into the bowl containing the orange zest.  Cut the onion in half lengthwise through the root. Cut each half into  3/4-inch-thick wedges keeping the root end intact. Do the same with the fennel bulb. Add the onion fennel and chicken pieces to the bowl. Toss the entire mixture well to combine. Let it stand covered at room temperature for 30 minutes or refrigerate it overnight.  Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 475 degrees  F.  Remove the chicken and vegetables from the marinade leaving as much liquid behind as possible (discard the liquid). Arrange the meat and vegetables in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast until the chicken is just cooked through about 30 minutes.  Turn the oven to broil and broil the chicken until it is blistery 1 to 2 minutes (watch it carefully). Transfer the chicken to a platter and tent it with aluminum foil to rest. Sprinkle the olives over the vegetables. If the vegetables look pale run the sheet quickly under the broiler until the vegetables brown and caramelize; watch them carefully so they don't burn. (If they don't need broiling just toss the vegetables and olives together in the baking sheet to warm up the olives.)  Arrange the reserved orange slices in a small roasting pan sprinkle the slices with sugar and broil until browned in spots 5 to 10 minutes. Scrape the vegetable mixture and the pan juices over the chicken and serve topped with the oranges and fennel fronds.

Bourbon Peach Pie,Ashley Cuoco,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Bourbon Peach Pie,1 pie; serves 8,Pie Crust: 2 1/2 (12 1/2 ounces) cups all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes  1/3 cup ice water  Bourbon Peach Filling: 4 pounds peaches peeled pitted and sliced  1/8-inch thick  1/2 cup granulated sugar  3/4 to  1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon bourbon 2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 2 tablespoon unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch cubes 1 egg lightly beaten Turbinado or coarse vanilla sugar   ,To make the dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring with the fork.   Gather the clumps of dough together on the work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.   To make the filling add peaches flour sugar lemon juice bourbon vanilla salt and spices to a large bowl. Stir with a large spoon until peaches are evenly coated.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove dough from the refrigerator and split in half. Place first half on a well-floured surface. Keep the second half chilled until ready to roll. Roll out the first half until it is roughly 10" in diameter. Lay into a 9 " metal pie dish and press into place.  Roll out the remaining half of dough in the same manner. Using a pastry wheel and a 1" ruler as a guide cut strips of dough and set on a well-floured baking sheet.  Pour filling into pie dish and dot with cubed butter. Add lattice dough strips and trim all rough edges leaving about a 1" border. Tuck the perimeter of the dough underneath itself to create a crust—crimp with your thumb and index fingers all the way around the pie.  Brush dough with the beaten egg and top with sugar. Bake pie on a parchment-lined baking sheet 60-70 minutes until golden brown and bubbling. Let cool at least 1 hour before slicing.  
Chocolate Hazelnut Spread,The Broken Bread,home/recipes/desserts/dessert-sauces/Chocolate Hazelnut Spread,just over 1 cup,1 cup raw hazelnuts 8 oz milk chocolate preferably from a bar 1 tbs cacao powder 1 tsp vanilla extract pinch sea salt 2 tbs neutral or hazelnut oil 2-3 tbs powdered sugar optional   ,Heat oven to 350 degrees  F. Place the hazelnuts onto a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes stirring once.   Allow the hazelnuts to cool then place them in the center of a kitchen towel. Fold the towel over the nuts and rub vigorously to remove the skins. Some skin may not come off which is totally okay.  Roughly chop the milk chocolate and transfer it to a small heat-safe bowl.

Place the spread in a sealable container and enjoy right away or allow some time for it to cool and use once thickened. Store at room temperature for up to a week.   *If the spread becomes too thick simply warm in the microwave or run the jar under hot water to thin it out again. 
Fig and Raspberry Tart with Honey,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen Image by Rosana Machiela,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Fig and Raspberry Tart with Honey,nch pie crust and 4 (4 1/2-inch) tarts,Tart: All-purpose flour for dusting 1 recipe Pie Dough (recipe follows) 1 cup mascarpone cheese  3/4 cup heavy whipping cream  3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons orange juice 8 fresh figs stemmed and quartered lengthwise 1- 1/2 cups (8-ounces) fresh raspberries picked over and rinsed 2 tablespoons honey warmed  Pie Dough: 1  3/4 cups (6  3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons granulated sugar   1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch cubes 3 to 4 tablespoons ice water   ,This colorful tart is bursting with fresh fruit flavors and is very simple to make. Prepare the tart shells and the cream filling ahead of time and assemble the tarts as you need them.  To make the dough: This recipe produces a simple lightly sweetened crust that can be used with all types of fillings. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month.  Place flour sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor or large mixing bowl. By pulsing or using a pastry blender cut the butter into the flour until the butter is the size of small peas.   Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Pulse or stir mixture until large clumps form. When enough water has been added to allow the dough to hold together transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Gather the dough together to form a ball. Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before using.    To make the tart: Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center of the oven.   b>To prepare the tart shell: Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and divide pie dough in four. Roll out each piece of pie dough into a circle with a 6-inch diameter. Fit dough circle into fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Bring the dough up the sides of the pan and trim any excess dough. Press dough gently into the flutes of the tin with the side of your finger to create a fluted edge. Repeat with remaining three pans. Transfer to the freezer until firm about 15 minutes.   To blind bake the tart shell: Line the chilled tart shell with heavy-duty foil pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 15 minutes until the foil comes away from the dough easily.  Remove the pan from the oven remove the foil and the pie weighs and prick the uncooked pastry base with a fork. Return pan to oven and continue baking the shell until the crust is golden-brown for about 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool.  To assemble the tart: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whip attachment beat the mascarpone cream and sugar until the mixture is smooth about 30 seconds. Stir in the orange juice and spread the mixture evenly across the bottom of the tart shells. Arrange the 8 fig quarters in each tart shell cut sides up fitting the figs tightly against the sides of the tart shell and each other. Arrange the raspberries in the center of the tart shell and drizzle the warmed honey all over the tart.  To serve: Remove the sides and bases of the tart pans and serve.

Clean the tip of the skewer each time you drag it through chocolate for a clean look. Repeat with remaining brownies glaze and chocolate. Refrigerate brownies until setup. 
Red White & Blue Quick Pops,Zoku,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Red White & Blue Quick Pops,3 to 6 pops,12 oz. of lemonade Red food coloring Blue food coloring 1 apple or pear for creating the stars   ,To create the colors use liquid or gel food coloring to dye lemonade red and blue; plain lemonade will create the white layer. If you are using gel dyes be sure to thoroughly stir your dyed lemonade to ensure that all of the dye has been dissolved into the liquid.  To make the stars slice an apple or pear 1/8 inch thick or less. Lay the fruit flat and cut with the star fruit stencil found in the Zoku Tool Kit. Attach the fruit slices using the end of the fruit wand (also found in the Zoku Tool Kit). Insert the prepared fruit wand into the pop mold pressing the fruit star against the wall of the cavity for about 10 seconds. Repeat as desired.  To create a red white and blue effect remember to pour your red lemonade in first. To achieve the look that is in the photo you'll want to use the following guidelines or you can estimate your desired proportions.   Remove your Zoku Quick Pop Maker from the freezer. Apply 3 stars to the top  1/3 of the Zoku Quick Pop cavities using the directions above.   Insert sticks. Pour  1/2 ounce plain lemonade into each Zoku Quick Pop cavity. Allow this layer to freeze completely.   Next pour  3/4 ounce of red lemonade into each cavity. Allow this layer to freeze completely.  Finally pour  3/4 ounce of blue lemonade into each cavity this last layer should reach the fill line. Allow this layer to freeze completely.   Remove the pops with the Super Tool and enjoy.   Note: Since we are using a layered method the amount of pops you can make per session will be reduced. This is because there is a longer freezing time due to the multiple layers.

Sous Vide Asparagus,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Sous Vide Asparagus,4 servings,1 pound asparagus 1 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (gallon) Ziploc bags   ,The color and flavor of cooking vegetables using sous-vide technology is unparalleled to standard cooking methods. Sous vide cooking allows us to cook at a temperature a bit below the boiling point of water so there is less risk of under/overcooking your vegetables. Furthermore sealing the vegetables before cooking in a water bath helps retain the natural plant sugars which would otherwise be diluted into a large volume of cooking water. That means brighter color and fuller flavor every time.  When we tested cooking asparagus in the Sansaire circulator we discovered that the vegetables contained more liquid and fibrous properties than proteins and therefore floated. Additionally when we compared cooking the asparagus lying flat in a bag with asparagus bunched at the bottom of the bag the asparagus which was cooked lying flat yield better color and flavor.  Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device's owner's manual for proper food-handling and safety procedures.    Choose a container large enough to hold your food with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the container using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator to 132 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.  Using a vegetable peeler peel the asparagus from the tip towards the base.   Line up the asparagus on a cutting board with the bottom of the Ziploc bag as your guide to how long your asparagus should be cut. Using a sharp knife carefully cut the asparagus so that the lengths are about the same size as the bag to enable the asparagus to snuggly fit into the bag.   Season the vegetables lightly with oil salt and pepper. Place the asparagus into the Ziploc bag so that the bottom of the asparagus is flat within the bag. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the vegetables. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag and leave the asparagus to circulate in the water until the vegetables are tender about 40 minutes.  To serve: Using tongs carefully remove the asparagus from the Ziploc bag into a warmed platter and serve immediately.

Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  To prepare pancakes: In a large bowl combine the zucchini garlic shallots zest cumin salt and pepper. Stir in the egg and thoroughly combine.  Using a silicone spatula add the flour and baking powder until just incorporated.  Line a large plate or baking sheet with paper towels.   To cook pancakes: Place a large nonstick skillet on the stove over a medium-high heat add the oil and heat until shimmering. Working batches add 2 tablespoons of the batter spreading them to form 3-inch fritters. Fry until golden-brown about 3 minutes. Using a small spatula remove and transfer the cooked fritters from the skillet to the paper towels and drain to remove the excess oil.    To serve: Arrange the warm fritters on a large platter and top with lime cilantro crema. Serve immediately.    
Strawberry Mascarpone Tartlets with Rhubarb Glaze,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Strawberry Mascarpone Tartlets with Rhubarb Glaze,16 tartlets,8 ounces thawed shredded phyllo dough 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter melted plus more for greasing muffin cups 2 tablespoons sugar 1 pound mascarpone (about 2 cups)   3/4 cup powdered sugar 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest  3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch of kosher salt 1 pint (16 ounces) strawberries hulled and cut into quarters lengthwise 4 cups (about 1- 1/2 pounds) fresh rhubarb trimmed and cut into  1/2-inch pieces 1- 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons water divided 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1- 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch   ,Shredded phyllo dough or kataifi is sold next to phyllo sheets in the freezer section of specialty markets and Middle Eastern groceries. It’s great for making these tartlet shells. You can bake the shells first thing in the morning and make the mascarpone filling and assemble the tarts just before your brunch guests arrive.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees and position a rack in the lower third. Lightly coat 16 muffin cups with the additional melted butter. Place the phyllo in a large mixing bowl and use your hands to gently separate the strands discarding any hard pieces or clumps of dough that refuse to separate. Pour melted butter over the phyllo and sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over the top. Toss gently with your hands until the phyllo is evenly coated with the butter and sugar.  Divide the buttered phyllo into 16 equal portions. Press 1 portion into each buttered muffin cup. Press firmly on the phyllo to compact the pastry to a  3/4-inch thickness and mold it to the bottom and sides of the cups to make room for the filling. Bake the phyllo shells for 17 to 20 minutes until the edges and bottoms are golden brown. The centers will still be light but will crisp upon cooling. If the entire shell is golden brown the phyllo will taste bitter. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.  Meanwhile to prepare the mascarpone filling whisk together mascarpone powdered sugar lemon juice zest vanilla and salt. Set aside.  To prepare rhubarb glaze place rhubarb sugar 2/3 cup water and lemon juice in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook until rhubarb is tender when pierced with a paring knife about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and strain rhubarb mixture through a fine-mesh strainer pressing on solids to remove as much liquid as possible. Pour strained rhubarb mixture into a small saucepan and heat over medium-high heat. Mix cornstarch with remaining 2 tablespoons water to dissolve. When rhubarb mixture boils whisk in cornstarch mixture and cook until mixture is thick and shiny about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and allow glaze to cool.

Brussels Sprouts Kimchi Puree and Bacon,All-Clad & Chef David Chang,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Brussels Sprouts Kimchi Puree and Bacon,4 servings,1 lb Brussels sprouts  3/4 lb. good quality smoky bacon cut into 1" to 1 1/2" inch long batons 1 cup Napa Cabbage Kimchi (see below) pureed 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup julienned carrots Napa Cabbage Kimchi: 1 small to medium head Napa cabbage discolored or loose outer leaves discarded 2 tablespoons Kosher or coarse sea salt  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 20 garlic cloves minced 20 slices peeled fresh ginger minced  3/4 cup kochukaru (Korean chile powder)   3/4 cup fish sauce  3/4 cup usukuchi (light soy sauce)  2 teaspoons jarred salted shrimp  1/2 cup 1-inch pieces scallions (greens and whites)  1/2 cup julienned carrots   ,Roasted Brussels sprouts tossed with bacon and served upon a bed of tangy Napa cabbage kimchi by Chef David Chang of Momofuku Restaurant Group.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Remove and discard the loose outer leaves from the sprouts and cut the sprouts in half through the core.  Put the bacon in an All-Clad 12" fry pan and cook over medium heat turning occasionally until just about crisp 5 minutes or so. With a slotted spoon transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and reserve.  Drain off most of the fat from the pan and add the sprouts cut side down in the same pan. Raise the heat to medium-high and sear until the sprouts begin to sizzle. Put the skillet in the oven and roast until the sprouts are deeply browned 8 minutes or so then shake the pan to redistribute them. Pull the pan from the oven when the sprouts are bright green and fairly tender (taste one to check) 10-15 minutes more.  Return the pan to the stovetop over medium heat and stir in the butter bacon and salt and pepper to taste. Toss the sprouts to coat them.  Divide the kimchi among four shallow bowls. Use the back of a spoon to spread the kimchi out so it covers the bottom of the bowls. Divide the sprouts among the bowls arranging them in a tidy pile on top of the kimchi. Garnish each with a pile of carrot julienne and serve.  Napa Cabbage Kimchi: We let the kimchi ferment for only a couple of weeks instead of allowing it to get really stinky and soft. There's a point after about two weeks where the bacteria that are fermenting the kimchi start producing CO2 and the kimchi takes on a prickly mouthfeel like the feeling of letting the bubbles in a soft drink pop on your tongue. It's right around then that I like it best.  Makes 1 to 1 1/2 quarts.  Cut the cabbage lengthwise in half then cut the halves crosswise into 1-inch-wide pieces. Toss the cabbage with the salt and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a bowl. Let sit overnight in the refrigerator.  Combine the garlic ginger kochukaru fish sauce soy sauce shrimp and remaining  1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl. If it is very thick add water  1/3 cup at a time until the brine is just thicker than a creamy salad dressing but no longer a sludge. Stir in the scallions and carrots.  Drain the cabbage and add it to the brine. Cover and refrigerate. Though the kimchi will be tasty in 24 hours it will be better in a week and at its prime in two weeks. It will still be good for another couple weeks after that though it will grow incrementally stronger and funkier.

If you want to stock up freeze tortellini in a single layer then transfer to sealable bags for long-term storage.      To make the filling:  Strain ricotta in a fine-mesh sieve over a medium bowl for at least 1 hour to remove excess liquid. Transfer ricotta to a medium bowl add goat cheese lemon zest Parmigiano-Reggiano egg salt and pepper; using a silicone spatula fold to combine and set aside.   To prepare the pasta:   Roll fresh pasta out into paper-thin sheets. Use a 3-inch pastry cutter to make rounds dust the tops of the pasta rounds with flour and cover loosely with a clean kitchen towel or a piece of plastic wrap. Repeat until all the pasta dough is used. (You can gather the pasta scraps and reroll them to make more rounds as long as they are still soft and workable.)   Fill and shape the tortellini:   Gather pasta rounds the filling a baking sheet coated with flour and a small bowl of water together next to a clean workspace. Line up 3 pasta rounds and place 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of each. Dip your finger in the bowl of water and run it along the edge of the round to moisten. Fold the dough over to form a half moon and press to seal. Next draw the two corners together to form a rounded bonnet shape and press the ends tightly together to seal. Place the tortellini on the floured baking sheet and repeat with remaining pasta rounds and filling.   To prepare the sauce:  To a large skillet over medium-high heat add olive oil. When oil is shimmering add pancetta and cook until crispy about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon transfer pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate. Reduce heat to medium and discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the skillet. Add butter shallot and garlic and cook until soft and translucent about 2 minutes. If using fresh peas add peas and  1/2 cup hot water. Stir well and simmer until peas are bright green and tender about 1 minute. (Omit water if using previously frozen peas.)  Remove pan from heat; taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside while preparing tortellini.   To cook the tortellini:   Heat a large pot of water over high heat until boiling. Generously season water with salt. Add tortellini and stir gently to prevent pasta from sticking together. Boil until the tortellini rise to the top of the water and filling is hot and cooked through 3 to 4 minutes.   Reserve about a cup of pasta water and use a fine-mesh sieve to transfer hot tortellini to skillet with sauce. Gently toss the pasta with the sauce adding the reserved pasta water as needed to thin the sauce. Add crispy pancetta and lemon juice and gently toss to combine. (Don't toss too much or pasta will break apart.)  To serve:   Taste and adjust seasoning with salt pepper and lemon juice. Divide tortellini among pasta bowls.

Herb-Laminated Pasta,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Herb-Laminated Pasta,4 servings,12  1/2 ounces (2  1/2 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon fine kosher salt 4 large eggs 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  Semolina flour for dusting pasta and surfaces  3/4 cup fresh tender herbs (tarragon dill parsley)   3/4 cup of water for brushing    ,To make the dough: Place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Make a "well" in the center of the flour mixture and add the eggs and oil. Using a fork blend the eggs into the flour mixture stirring the flour in from the sides of the well and working outwards. When the pasta dough is thoroughly mixed turn it out on a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky adding small amounts of flour as needed about 5 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and flatten it into a disk. Cover with plastic wrap and rest for at least 20 minutes or up to an hour at room temperature.   To roll out and cut the dough:  Secure a pasta machine to the edge of a long countertop or using a stand mixer attach the pasta maker attachment. Using a bench scraper cut the dough into 4 pieces. Keep the extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with 1 piece. With a rolling pin roll the piece of dough into a rough rectangle that will fit inside the widest setting of the pasta machine. Roll the dough through the machine catching it with 1 hand as you roll with the other. Take the dough and trifold it like a letter. Turn the dough so one open end faces the machine and roll it through on the widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting.    Continue rolling the pasta through the machine without folding adjusting the rollers to a smaller setting each time until the desired thickness is reached. If the pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.   To prepare pasta sheets:  Roll fresh pasta dough into sheets finishing on the thinnest machine setting. Lay the sheets on a lightly floured work surface and cut into even squares about 5 x 5-inches. Very lightly brush pasta with water. Working quickly so pasta does not become dry and brittle distribute herbs evenly across half of the pasta squares leaving  1/2-inch space around each leaf and a 1-inch border around the edges. Cover with the remaining pasta squares and press lightly to adhere. Adjust the pasta machine rollers to the second thinnest setting and gently pass the layered pasta squares through the machine. If necessary use a bench scraper to trim the pasta squares to fit inside individual shallow pasta bowls. Place pasta sheets on a baking sheet dusted with flour cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and set aside.

Pumpkin has a distinct squash flavor that you want to enhance without overpowering it. I’ve filled the prebaked crust with a lightly spiced pumpkin mixture that tastes more like a mousse than a dense custard. Dark rum and grated orange zest are my secret ingredients. - Ina Garten  Prepare the pie crust: Cut the butter in  1/2-inch dice and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. Place the flour sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out onto a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle at least 1 inch larger than the pie pan rolling from the center to the edge turning and flouring the dough so it doesn't stick to the board. (You should see bits of butter in the dough.) Fold the dough in half ease it into the pie pan without stretching at all and unfold to fit the pan. With a small sharp paring knife cut the dough 1 inch larger around than the pan. Fold the edge under and crimp the edge with either your fingers or the tines of a fork.  NOTE: Store the shortening in the refrigerator so it's always cold. You can store the prepared pie crust in the fridge for up to a day.  Make the pie: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Line an 11-inch pie pan with the unbaked pie crust and place it on a sheet pan. Line the crust with parchment paper. Fill the paper  3/4 full with the beans and bake the crust for 15 minutes until the edges start to brown. Remove the beans and paper (save the beans for another time) prick the crust all over with the tines of a fork and bake for another 5 minutes.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.  Meanwhile in a large bowl whisk together the pumpkin brown sugar granulated sugar cinnamon ginger nutmeg salt orange zest eggs cream milk and rum. Pour the filling into the baked pie shell.  Bake for 55 to 65 minutes until the filling is just set in the middle and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Set aside to cool completely. Serve with the rum whipped cream.  Rum Whipped Cream: Place the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sugar mascarpone rum and vanilla. Beat on medium-high until it forms soft peaks. Serve with the pumpkin pie.  NOTE: If you overwhip the cream and it looks curdled just add a little more cream and whip it until it forms soft peaks.

Cover and let it whistle at least 6 to 7 times. Let it cool in the pressure cooker. If you do not have a pressure cooker cook it in a large saucepan covered on medium heat and let it cook for 45 minutes to an hour. The water may reduce faster when boiling the lentils in this method. Add more water to make sure that the lentils are always covered. The lentil should be soft to the touch and should be completely smashed between your index finger and thumb on a light touch.   Grind the ginger garlic and green chilies into a paste in a chopper/grinder.   In a medium saucepan on medium heat add in the ghee. Now add in the cumin seeds asafoetida cloves cinnamon cardamom pods bay leaves and saute for 30 seconds. Add in the ginger-garlic-green chili paste and saute for another minute. Add in the tomato paste and saute for another minute to form a paste mixture. Add in the garam masala remaining  1/2 tsp of salt (more If required) and red chili powder and mix well. Add in the boiled lentils along with all the water and mix. Add in the dried fenugreek leaves and stir. Let the daal cook over medium heat for 25 minutes stirring every couple of minutes to make sure that the daal does not stick to the bottom of the pan. Add the heavy cream halfway through the 25 minutes. Add 1 cup water if you see the daal is looking too thick.   Once the daal is done garnish with the cilantro drizzle with 1 tbsp heavy cream and top with ginger slivers. The daal is ready to eat with naan roti or simply plain rice!

Keep them on a parchment paper and covered with a towel for 10 minutes.   Heat a flat griddle on the stove on medium heat. Now flatten each round dough piece. Sprinkle some flour on the board where you will roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Start rolling out the dough into a round shape or elongated shape. It should roll out to about 7 to 8 inches diameter. Spread about 1 tsp grated garlic and 1 tsp chopped cilantro onto the rolled dough and press it lightly with your hands. Gently brush the griddle with vegetable oil.  Now lay the rolled out dough garlic-side down onto the griddle and let it puff up for 2 minutes. You will see air pockets form on the surface. Turn it over and cook for another minute pressing it lightly on the surface with your spatula. Air pockets will form. Lightly brush the garlic side with melted butter and remove it from the griddle.   Repeat the same with all the naans and they are ready to eat!   
Smothered Pork Chops,Quin Liburd,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Smothered Pork Chops,2-4 servings,4 bone-in ribeye pork chops (about 2.5 lbs)  kosher salt freshly ground black pepper garlic powder smoked paprika 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons olive oil  1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 medium-sized white onion sliced and cut into half moons 4 garlic cloves minced 2 teaspoons fresh thyme destemmed 2 cups chicken stock  1/2 cup heavy whipping cream   ,Use a paper towel and pat dry the pork chops on both sides. Season each pork chop with salt pepper garlic powder and smoked paprika on all sides. Then set the pork chops aside. In a large non-stick skillet (at least 10 inches or larger) melt the butter/olive oil over medium heat. Meanwhile while the butter/oil is on the stove; add the flour into a shallow pie plate or dish. Dip each pork chop into the flour coating well on all sides and then shake off any excess flour. Add the floured pork chops to a small baking sheet and repeat the process until all of the pork chops are coated in flour- but do not discard the remaining flour. When the butter/oil is sizzling add the pork chops into the skillet. Depending on the size of your chops you may have to cook them in batches. Cook the pork chops for about 4-5 minutes on both sides. Then transfer the fried pork chops to a small baking sheet and cover them with foil. Add the onions into the skillet and saute them together stirring every few minutes. Allow the onions to break down and caramelize until they reach a deeply golden brown color about 10-12 minutes. Then add in the garlic and stir together until fragrant about 1-2 minutes. Take 2 tablespoons of the reserved flour and sprinkle it into the skillet. Stir the flour into the onion mixture until all of the flour begins to dissolve. The flour should absorb most if not all of any butter/oil left in the skillet- making sure that all of the flour has fully dissolved. Sprinkle in the fresh thyme and stir together once more. Pour in the stock and heavy cream and stir to fully combine everything. Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the mixture to come up to a simmer. Stir together and then you should see the gravy begin to thicken. Taste the gravy and adjust it to your preference by adding more salt/pepper if desired. Then add in the pork chops and spoon the gravy over them. Serve the smothered pork chops warm and over mashed potatoes rice or alongside desired side items. Enjoy!

Add the onions stirring frequently until tender and lightly caramelized 5 to 8 minutes. Add red pepper and garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes pimenton salt and bay. Reduce heat to medium and stir frequently until the sauce is thick and turns a deep brick red color about 10 minutes.   Bring chicken broth to a simmer in a large saucepan; reduce heat to low and cover to keep broth hot.   To prepare the paella: Push the sofrito to the side of the pan and add oil.

If the rice is browned and caramelized on the bottom of the pan and the rice grains are al dente (chewy but slightly resistant texture) remove from heat; sprinkle peas over the rice and cover letting the paella rest for 10 minutes.   To serve: Garnish with lemon wedges and serve family-style straight from the pan.
