Pureed with onions and broth they make a velvety soup the color of ivory. Float crisp fried sage leaves on top for a dramatic garnish or top more simply with a sliver of butter and sprinkling of chives.  Peel the parsnips with a vegetable peeler and trim the thick stem end. Remove any part of the slender tip that is thinner than a pencil. Cut the trimmed parsnips into manageable lengths of about 3 inches and then quarter lengthwise. With a paring knife cut away and discard the hard central core. Cut the trimmed parsnips into  1/2-inch dice. You should have about 5 cups.  Melt the butter in a large heavy pot over moderate heat. Add the onion and celery and cook stirring often until the onion starts to color 7 to 8 minutes. Add the parsnips broth and thyme sprigs and bring to a simmer. Cover adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the parsnips are tender about 20 minutes.  Remove the thyme sprigs.

Grilled Eggplant Cannelloni with Ricotta and Prosciutto,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/main-courses/vegetarian/Grilled Eggplant Cannelloni with Ricotta and Prosciutto,4 servings,  2 large globe eggplants 1 3/4 to 1 1/2 pounds each Kosher or sea salt 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  Tomato Sauce:  3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil  1/2 yellow onion minced 2 large cloves garlic minced 1 1/2 pounds plum (Roma type) tomatoes chopped (no need to peel) 8 to 12 fresh basil leaves 1 teaspoon dried oregano Pinch of hot red pepper flakes Kosher or sea salt  Ricotta Filling: 2 cups whole-milk ricotta cheese (or one 15-oz. container)  1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese 1/3 cup minced prosciutto 2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley 1 large clove garlic minced Freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg lightly beaten   1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese for topping   , Lengthwise slices from a large eggplant become supple when grilled so you can roll them around a ricotta filling as if you were making cannelloni from pasta squares. Blanketed with a homemade fresh-tomato sauce and baked until bubbly and a little crusty around the edges the fork-tender bundles of stuffed eggplant are the ultimate Italian comfort food.  Slice off the eggplants' green cap then cut each eggplant lengthwise into slices about 1&frasl;3 inch thick. Discard the first and last slices which are mostly skin. You should get at least 6 large slices from each eggplant. Sprinkle them generously on both sides with salt then set the slices on a rack and let stand for 30 minutes. Moisture will bead on the surface.  Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium (375&deg;F). Pat the eggplant slices dry with paper towels then brush on both sides with the olive oil. Place the slices directly over the coals or gas flame and cook turning once until they are nicely marked by the grill and pliable about 3 minutes per side. They do not need to be fully cooked as they will cook further in the oven. Set the slices aside on a tray to cool.  To make the tomato sauce heat the olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion is soft and beginning to color 5 to 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook stirring often until they soften and collapse into a sauce about 10 minutes depending on ripeness.  Remove from the heat and pass the mixture through a food mill fitted with the fine disk. Return the puree to the skillet over moderate heat. Tear the basil leaves in half and add to the skillet along with the oregano (rubbing it between your fingers as you do) the hot pepper flakes and salt to taste. Simmer gently stirring occasionally until the sauce is thick and tasty. Set aside.  To make the ricotta filling put the ricotta pecorino prosciutto parsley and garlic in a medium bowl. Stir until blended then season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the egg.  Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Choose a shallow baking dish large enough to hold all the eggplant rolls snugly in one layer. Spread 1&frasl;3 cup of the tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish.  Put a generous 2 tablespoons filling on each eggplant slice and spread it evenly. Carefully roll each slice like a jelly roll and place the rolls seam side down in the baking dish. Top with the remaining tomato sauce spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the pecorino evenly over the top. Bake until lightly browned and bubbling about 45 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes before serving.   
Bourbon Peach Pie,Ashley Cuoco,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Bourbon Peach Pie,1 pie; serves 8,  Pie Crust: 2 1/2 (12 1/2 ounces) cups all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes  1/3 cup ice water  Bourbon Peach Filling: 4 pounds peaches peeled pitted and sliced  1/8-inch thick  1/2 cup granulated sugar  3/4 to  1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon bourbon 2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 2 tablespoon unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch cubes 1 egg lightly beaten Turbinado or coarse vanilla sugar   , To make the dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring with the fork.   Gather the clumps of dough together on the work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.   To make the filling add peaches flour sugar lemon juice bourbon vanilla salt and spices to a large bowl. Stir with a large spoon until peaches are evenly coated.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove dough from the refrigerator and split in half. Place first half on a well-floured surface. Keep the second half chilled until ready to roll. Roll out the first half until it is roughly 10" in diameter. Lay into a 9 " metal pie dish and press into place.  Roll out the remaining half of dough in the same manner. Using a pastry wheel and a 1" ruler as a guide cut strips of dough and set on a well-floured baking sheet.  Pour filling into pie dish and dot with cubed butter. Add lattice dough strips and trim all rough edges leaving about a 1" border. Tuck the perimeter of the dough underneath itself to create a crust—crimp with your thumb and index fingers all the way around the pie.  Brush dough with the beaten egg and top with sugar. Bake pie on a parchment-lined baking sheet 60-70 minutes until golden brown and bubbling. Let cool at least 1 hour before slicing.

Tagliatelle Carbonara with Crispy Mushrooms Recipe,Molly Krebs,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Tagliatelle Carbonara with Crispy Mushrooms Recipe,4 servings,  2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks 1 1/2 cups finely grated parmesan cheese divided plus extra for serving  3/4 teaspoon salt  3/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 8 slices thick-cut bacon chopped  3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 pound wild mushrooms sliced 1 pound tagliatelle pasta  1/2 cup reserved pasta water 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 1-2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley	 Fresh basil leaves for serving   , In a medium mixing bowl whisk together the eggs egg yolks 1 cup of the parmesan cheese salt and pepper until smooth. Set aside while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the chopped bacon. Cook for 8 minutes or until bacon is golden brown and crispy. Remove bacon from pan and add to a paper towel lined plate. Pour bacon fat into a small bowl leaving 1-2 tablespoons in the pan for the mushrooms. Save the reserved bacon fat for the sauce later. Meanwhile bring a pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.  Add  3/4 cup olive oil to the skillet with the 1-2 tablespoons of bacon fat. Heat over medium-high heat and once hot add the mushrooms and a few cracks of freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 12-15 minutes tossing the mushrooms only a few times so that they get deeply golden and crispy. Once they're finished season with salt and stir in the chopped rosemary. Remove mushrooms from pan and set aside. Add the reserved bacon fat to the skillet so that it's ready for the pasta!  At this point your pasta water should be boiling. Add your pasta and cook according to package directions or until just al dente. Remember to reserve your pasta water (I just scoop a bunch out with a large mug or heat-safe glass measuring cup!) Drain pasta and quickly pour it back into the pan with the bacon fat. Quickly add the egg-parmesan mixture and a splash of pasta water (start with 1/4 cup) and working quickly using tongs toss the pasta to combine it with the mixture to create a creamy "sauce". Add the remaining 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and keep tossing until melted and combined. Add a splash or so more of the pasta water (up to the remaining  3/4 cup) if it seems like it needs more moisture. Season with freshly cracked black pepper. You most likely won't need any salt since bacon and parmesan are salty enough on their own! Add chopped fresh parsley and toss once more. Top with the crispy mushrooms. Serve immediately with extra grated parmesan and fresh basil.

Homemade Potato Dough,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/breads/dough/Homemade Potato Dough,1 serving,  1 small (5 ounces) russet potato peeled and quartered 1/2 tablespoon active dry yeast 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar 1/2 stick (2 ounces) unsalted butter room temperature plus more for greasing 1/2 cup (4 ounces) whole milk warmed to 110 to 115 degrees  F 1 large egg room temperature 2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) bread flour or all-purpose flour plus more  1 teaspoon kosher salt   , Bread bakers have been using potatoes (and potato cooking water) for many years. Yeast loves the starchy carbohydrates in potatoes and their lumpy texture adds not only flavor and moisture but also a chewy softness - ideal for dinner rolls. Serve these at a family dinner and watch them disappear.   1. To prepare potatoes:   To a small saucepan add potatoes and cover with cold water. Set saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook until potatoes can be easily pierced with a knife about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and reserve 1/2 cup of cooking water. Return potatoes to pan and using a potato masher or fork mash until smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature.  2. To prepare dough:    To a small saucepan set over medium heat add reserved potato water. Heat water to 110 to 115 degrees  F and pour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar and whisk by hand to blend. Allow mixture to sit until yeast is activated and foamy or bubbling about 5 to 10 minutes.   3. To stand mixer bowl add 1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) mashed potatoes. Add remaining sugar softened butter milk and egg; whisk by hand until well blended. Add flour and salt and mix on low speed until dough begins to come together about 2 to 3 minutes. The dough will be sticky and wet. With mixer on low add additional flour a tablespoon at a time until dough begins to pull away from sides of bowl. Turn speed to medium-low and continue to knead until dough feels firm dense and springy about 5 to 6 minutes. Note: This dough is soft and sticky and will not pull away from the sides completely. Do not over-knead or starch from potatoes will break down and make dough gooey.  4. Lightly butter a large mixing bowl. Transfer dough to bowl and lightly coat surface of dough with a little softened butter. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let dough rise until doubled in size 45 to 60 minutes (longer if room is cold).   5. To cold-proof dough:  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press down on dough firmly to expel some air bubbles. Return dough to mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Transfer bowl to refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.

Glazed Lemon Yogurt and Olive Oil Pound Cake,Aran Goyoaga,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Glazed Lemon Yogurt and Olive Oil Pound Cake,1 LOAF, For the cake  1 cup (200 g) sugar 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest (from 2 to 3 medium lemons)  1 cup (140 g) superfine brown rice flour 1 cup (100 g) almond flour any lumps broken up 3 large eggs  1/2 cup (115 g) whole-milk yogurt or Cashew-Coconut Yogurt   1/2 cup (110 g) extra-virgin olive oil plus more for greasing 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon baking powder  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt    For the glaze  2 cups (240 g) powdered sugar 2 to 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 tablespoons finely chopped pistachios for topping   , This is the basic snack cake of my childhood. I would come home from school to find it displayed on an old red melamine tray cooling on the outdoor balcony. It is very lemony and moist with a simple glaze. You can add orange zest or poppy seeds to it if you'd like.  1.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the inside of an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan with a little bit of olive oil.  2.    To make the cake in a large bowl rub together the sugar and lemon zest until fragrant. This helps release the natural lemon oil. Whisk in the remaining ingredients until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes then invert onto a wire rack. Let the cake cool completely if you want the glaze to stay thick on top of the cake. If the cake is warm the glaze will melt and run off.  3.    To make the glaze in a medium bowl whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth and lump free. As you begin to whisk it might seem too thick but as the sugar absorbs the juice the glaze will thin out. The glaze should be pourable but not too runny.   4.    Put a tray or baking sheet under the wire rack and pour the glaze all over the cake letting it run over the edges. Wait a few minutes for the glaze to set. Sprinkle the top with the pistachios then serve. The cake will keep at room temperature for 3 days. If you refrigerate it the glaze will soften.  &#169;2021 by Aran Goyoaga.

If you're using Thai chiles are extremely hot; you can reduce the heat by removing the seeds before adding them to this dish.

Cover and refrigerate shrimp for 10 minutes.  To cook shrimp: Place oil in a large wok or skillet on the stove over moderate heat.

Sous Vide Asparagus,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Sous Vide Asparagus,4 servings,  1 pound asparagus 1 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (gallon) Ziploc bags   , The color and flavor of cooking vegetables using sous-vide technology is unparalleled to standard cooking methods. Sous vide cooking allows us to cook at a temperature a bit below the boiling point of water so there is less risk of under/overcooking your vegetables. Furthermore sealing the vegetables before cooking in a water bath helps retain the natural plant sugars which would otherwise be diluted into a large volume of cooking water. That means brighter color and fuller flavor every time.  When we tested cooking asparagus in the Sansaire circulator we discovered that the vegetables contained more liquid and fibrous properties than proteins and therefore floated. Additionally when we compared cooking the asparagus lying flat in a bag with asparagus bunched at the bottom of the bag the asparagus which was cooked lying flat yield better color and flavor.  Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device's owner's manual for proper food-handling and safety procedures.    Choose a container large enough to hold your food with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the container using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator to 132 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.  Using a vegetable peeler peel the asparagus from the tip towards the base.   Line up the asparagus on a cutting board with the bottom of the Ziploc bag as your guide to how long your asparagus should be cut. Using a sharp knife carefully cut the asparagus so that the lengths are about the same size as the bag to enable the asparagus to snuggly fit into the bag.   Season the vegetables lightly with oil salt and pepper. Place the asparagus into the Ziploc bag so that the bottom of the asparagus is flat within the bag. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the vegetables. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag and leave the asparagus to circulate in the water until the vegetables are tender about 40 minutes.  To serve: Using tongs carefully remove the asparagus from the Ziploc bag into a warmed platter and serve immediately.

Polenta with Broccoli Rabe and Fried Eggs,Dinner,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Polenta with Broccoli Rabe and Fried Eggs,6 servings,  1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt plus more as needed 1 bay leaf 1 1/2 cups polenta 4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 to 3 garlic cloves smashed and peeled 2 bunches broccoli rabe thick stems and wilted leaves trimmed Large pinch of red chile flakes 6 large eggs Freshly ground black pepper to taste Chunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for shaving   ,  This is one of my go-to I-don't-feel-like-shopping dinners. Because I always have polenta and eggs in the house and usually there's something green to saute I can make it when it's stormy out or if I'm working late on a deadline or if I'd just rather go for a run than run to the store. You can substitute other greens like kale or spinach for the broccoli rabe; I do this often since they're both regulars in my CSA box. Just note that spinach and kale cook up more quickly than the rabe so keep an eye on them. Or leave out the sauteed veggies altogether and serve the creamy polenta with a big crisp green salad-a perfect plan if your CSA leans harder on lettuces than braising greens.  In a medium pot combine 6 cups of water (or use broth if you prefer) 1 3/4 teaspoons of the salt and the bay leaf. Bring to a simmer and then slowly whisk in the polenta. Stir frequently until the polenta has thickened enough that it no longer sinks to the bottom of the pot 5 to 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low cover the pot and simmer very gently until tender 15 to 30 minutes (depending on the coarseness of the grind). Remove the bay leaf and stir in the butter.  While the polenta is cooking place a 10- or 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and heat until it is shimmering. Stir in the smashed garlic and cook until it is golden brown and tender 3 to 5 minutes.  Toss the broccoli rabe and chile flakes into the skillet and cook until the leaves wilt and the stems just begin to color about 3 minutes. Season with the remaining  1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in  3/4 cup of water partially cover the skillet and cook until the stems are tender about 10 minutes. If there's liquid left in the pan take the cover off raise the heat and let it evaporate.  Transfer the broccoli rabe to a plate and wipe out the skillet if necessary. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and let it heat up. Crack the eggs into the skillet and season them with salt and pepper to taste. Fry the eggs sunny-side-up or flip them over for over-easy.  Spoon the polenta into bowls and top each serving with broccoli rabe and a fried egg. Use a vegetable peeler to shave curls of Parmigiano-Reggiano over the bowl.

Quick Coq au Vin,Jacques Pepin Poulets & Legumes,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Quick Coq au Vin,4 servings,  1 chicken (3 1/2- to 4-pounds) or 2 whole boneless chicken legs plus 2 whole boneless skinless breasts 12 small pearl onions 2 tablespoons olive oil  1/2 teaspoon sugar  1/2 cup water 4 large mushrooms (4 ounces) cleaned and quartered  1/3 cup finely chopped onion 3 garlic cloves crushed and finely chopped (2 teaspoons) 1 1/2 cups fruity dry robust red wine (such as Syrah or Grenache) 1 fresh thyme sprig or  1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley &#190 teaspoon salt  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon potato starch dissolved in 2 tablespoons red wine  Croutons 4 slices firm white bread (4 ounces)  2 teaspoons canola oil   , Traditionally coq au vin or chicken with red wine had to be cooked for a long time because the coq ("cock"-an older chicken) was tough. Now the dish can be made quickly with tender parts either cut from a young chicken or bought separately at the market. I divide the chicken into pieces remove the skin brown it and cook it in the red wine adding the breasts at the end so they don’t get overdone. I glaze the onions separately in a little olive oil and sugar stirring the mushrooms in near the end. Finally I combine everything and serve it with large heart-shaped croutons.  If using a whole chicken cut off the wings and cut them at the joints into 3 pieces each. Cut the chicken into 4 pieces: 2 breasts and 2 legs. Skin and bone the breasts. Set the breasts aside with the 4 meatier wing pieces. (Freeze the bones and wing tips for stock if desired.)  To bone the chicken legs first pull off the skin and cut the tips off the drumsticks. Then cut down each side of the thighbone and slide your knife under the bone to separate the meat from it. Holding the thighbone cut all around the joint at the knee to loosen the meat. Scrape down the drumstick bone and pull out the bones. Set the legs aside with the breasts and wing pieces.  Put the pearl onions 1 tablespoon of the oil the sugar and the water in a large saucepan bring to a boil over high heat and boil until the water has evaporated and the onions start frying. Continue to cook stirring or shaking the pan occasionally until the onions are glazed on all sides. Add the mushrooms and saute for 1 minute. Set aside covered.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet. When it is hot add the chicken wing pieces if you have them and saute for 2 to 3 minutes until lightly browned on all sides. Add the legs and brown for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Add the breasts and brown for 2 minutes on each side. Remove all the chicken pieces to a plate.  Add the chopped onion to the drippings in the skillet and saute for 1 minute. Add the garlic and cook for about 10 seconds. Add the wine thyme bay leaves salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Return the legs and the wings to the pan cover and boil very gently for 5 minutes. Add the chicken breasts and boil gently for another 6 minutes.  Add the dissolved potato starch to the chicken and stir until the pan juices are thickened. Add the pearl onions and mushrooms with their juices. Keep warm.  Croutons: Meanwhile trim the crusts from the bread and cut each slice diagonally in half to form 2 triangles. Trim each triangle into a heart-shaped crouton.   Spread the oil on a cookie sheet and press the croutons into the oil so they are moistened on both sides. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until nicely browned.  At serving time dip the top of each crouton into the sauce to moisten it and then into the chopped parsley. Cut the chicken breast pieces and legs in half serve 1 breast piece 1 drumstick or thigh and if you have them 1 piece of wing per person with 2 croutons along with some of the sauce and vegetables. Sprinkle the remaining chopped parsley over the chicken.

A double dose of almond here accents the fruit filling within. The cakelike topping bursts with the rich presence of almond paste while almond liqueur gives a hint of flavor when tossed with the sliced fruit.  Filling: In the large bowl toss together the apricot slices cherries sugar and amaretto until all the fruit is coated evenly. Use the spatula to scrape into the baking dish and spread in an even layer.  Topping: Place the sugar and almond paste in the bowl of the stand mixer and beat on medium speed until the almond paste is broken into tiny pieces. Add the softened butter and beat on medium-high until the mixture is very light in color almost white 4 to 5 minutes. Scrape down the bowl. Add the egg and vanilla and blend well. Scrape down the bowl.  In the medium bowl whisk together the flour baking powder and salt. With the mixer on lowest speed add the flour mixture and milk alternately to the butter. Scrape down the bowl and finish blending by hand with the spatula.  Cover the fruit by letting the batter fall off the spatula in long bands over the fruit (don't try to spread it or it will sink into the fruit). Use the spatula to gently blend the bands of batter together until it covers the fruit in a single layer.  Bake and serve the cobbler:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center.  You may want to place a baking sheet or a piece of foil under the cobbler to catch any juices that may bubble over. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until the topping is nicely browned and a toothpick or skewer inserted into the topping comes out clean. The fruit should be bubbling and soft. Serve warm accompanied by vanilla or dulce de leche ice cream or softly whipped almond cream.

Spaghetti alla Chitarra,by Academia Barilla adapted by the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Spaghetti alla Chitarra,10 servings,  1 pound 10 oz. semolina 1 1/2 pounds Caputo 00 flour 3 large eggs 1 cup water 35.2 oz. Tomato Sauce Academia Barilla 4 oz. Parmigiano-Reggiano Academia Barilla   , Chitarra literally "guitar" is a wire-strung wooden frame used to make a rustic pasta called maccheroni alla chitara. The chitarra is used throughout the region of Abruzzo in central Italy. Never get your chitarra wet. Dust flour and any bits of dried pasta off the chitarra with a stiff brush or dry towel. The dough of maccheroni alla chitarra is a mixture of fine semolina and pasta flours.  Mound the flours in the center of a clean work surface. Mix together both flours and make a well in the middle of the flour add the eggs and water. Using a fork beat together the eggs and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well. As you incorporate the eggs keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. The dough will come together into a shaggy mass when over half of the flour is incorporated.   Start kneading the dough with both hands primarily using the palms of your hands. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Once the dough comes together in a cohesive mass remove the dough from the work surface using a bench scraper to scrape up all the dough. Lightly flour the board and knead for 5 minutes. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes remembering to dust your work surface with flour when necessary. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and set aside for 20 minutes at room temperature.  Roll out the dough through a pasta machine into very thin sheets (If using an Atlas Pasta Machine roll dough to number 5) then dry the pasta for a few minutes. To cut the pasta using the chitarra lay a sheet of pasta over the strings using a rolling pin and applying gentle pressure roll the pin over the pasta. Take your fingers run them down the chitarra crosswise to loosen the pasta.  Cook the pasta in a large pasta pot with salted broiling water. Drain and saute in a saucepan with Academia Barilla tomato sauce. Serve topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

Please consult your owner's manual for proper cooking times food handling and safety procedures.   Dark Meat Turkey Confit: Note: The fat from the skin renders during cooking providing liquid and liquid fat for the gravy. If you wish to add additional fat as in a traditional confit you may use duck fat butter or even olive oil.  Preheat your water bath to 140 degrees F.   Combine sugar salt garlic rosemary and black pepper in a large bowl. Add turkey legs (skin on) and toss to coat. Transfer turkey legs and sugar mixture to a bag (or divide into separate bags) and seal with vacuum sealer. Add to preheated water bath and cook for 24 hours.  Turkey Breast: Place turkey breasts (skin on) in a vacuum bag with olive oil salt aromatics and pepper. Seal the bag and add to the sous vide bath containing the dark meat. Continue cooking at 140 degrees F for 2 1/2 hours minimum or up to 8 hours maximum.  Browning and serving turkey: Arrange the top rack of your oven so it is 8 to 12 inches below the heating element and preheat your oven to broil.   Unbag the dark meat decanting and reserving any liquid that has accumulated for gravy (below).   Unbag the white meat. Arrange the dark and white meat turkey pieces skin-side-up on a baking sheet. Blot the pieces dry.  Roast under the broiler watching continuously until the skin browns about 2 to 5 minutes.   Slice the turkey breast into  1/2" medallions and arrange on a serving platter alongside the dark meat pieces.  Rich Turkey Gravy: Melt the duck fat in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Drizzle in the decanted turkey drippings while blending with an immersion blender until fully incorporated. The mixture will thicken. If you don't have an immersion blender you can combine the melted duck fat and drippings in a standard blender.

Foolproof Apple Pie,King Arthur Flour Company Inc.,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Foolproof Apple Pie,1 pie, Filling:  8 cups sliced apples 2 tablespoons lemon juice  3/4 cup sugar  3/4 cup King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 tablespoons cornstarch  3/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon nutmeg  3/4 teaspoon allspice  3/4 cup boiled cider or undiluted apple juice concentrate 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream for glazing 1 tablespoon granulated sugar for glazing  Perfect Pie Crust:    1- 1/2 cups Perfect Pastry Blend or King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour    1/2 teaspoon salt   4 tablespoons shortening   5 tablespoons unsalted butter   3 to 5 tablespoons ice water    , Make smiles appear at your next holiday function with this traditional spiced apple pie topped with a whipping cream glazed crust.  To make the pie crust:  Whisk together the flour and salt.   Add the shortening working it in until the mixture is evenly crumbly. 	  Add the butter to the flour mixture and work it in roughly with your fingers a pastry cutter or a mixer.  Don't be too thorough; the mixture should be very uneven with big chunks of butter in among the smaller ones. 	  Add 2 tablespoons of water and toss to combine. 	  Toss with enough additional water to make a chunky mixture. It should barely hold together when you squeeze a handful though the remainder may look quite dry. 	  Scoop the mixture out onto a piece of parchment or waxed paper and flatten it out a bit. Take a spray bottle of water and spritz the dry parts with the water. 	  Using the parchment or waxed paper fold the dough over on itself - first from one side then from the other. You'll find that the dry crumbs are becoming incorporated with the cohesive dough. If there are still dry areas spritz them with additional water and fold the dough on itself again. Keep folding and gathering until just a few dry crumbs remain unincorporated; this should only take a few folds. 	  Shape the dough into a disk about 1" thick and refrigerate for 30 minutes or longer; this resting period allows the flour to absorb the water thus making the dough easier to roll out.  	 When you're "ready to roll " remove the dough from the fridge. If the dough has been refrigerated longer than 30 minutes let it rest at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before rolling to allow the butter to soften up a bit. 	  To make the filling and assemble the pie:   Lightly grease a 9-" pie pan that's at least "es deep. This will make serving the pie easier after it's baked.  Combine the sliced apples and lemon juice in a large mixing bowl.  In a small bowl whisk together the sugar flour cornstarch salt and spices. Sprinkle the mixture over the apples and stir to coat them. Stir in the boiled cider or apple juice concentrate.   Roll out half of the pastry to a 13" circle. Transfer it to the prepared pan and trim the edges so they overlap the rim of the pan by an inch all the way around.  Spoon the apple filling into the pan. Dot the top with the diced butter.  Roll out the remaining pastry to an 11" circle. Cut decorative vent holes if desired. Carefully place the pastry over the apples.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees   Roll the overhanging bottom crust up and over the top crust pinching to seal the two.   lute the edges of the pie then place it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to firm up the crust while the oven finishes heating.  Place the pie on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Use a silicone pastry brush to coat the top of the pie with milk and sprinkle with sugar.   Bake the pie for 20 minutes at 425 degrees  then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees  and bake for 40 minutes more until the filling bubbles inside the pie. Check the pie after half an hour of baking time and cover the edges with foil or a pie shield to keep them from browning too quickly.   When the pie is done remove it from the oven and cool it completely before slicing.  
Bourbon Pecan Pie,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Bourbon Pecan Pie,1 (9-inch) pie, Pecan Pie Filling  2 cups pecans whole or halved 1 tablespoon bourbon 3 large eggs 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup granulated sugar  3/4 cup light corn syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  1/2 teaspoon salt  Pastry dough Recipe adapted from The Art and Soul of Baking by Sur La Table and Cindy Mushet. Yields 1 9-inch pie crust   1- 3/4 cups all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  1/2 cup unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes  3/4 to  1/3 cup ice water   , Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack to the lower-third of the oven.  To make the dough: Either place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl or into a bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. If using a mixing bowl use a pastry blender two knives or your fingers to cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring.  If using a food processor add the cut butter to the flour and pulse mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Drizzle in ice water and pulse until the flour holds together.   Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.  To prepare the filling: Place the butter in a medium saucepan and melt on the stove over a moderate heat. When melted add the sugar and stir until smooth about 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and whisk in the corn syrup vanilla bourbon and salt. In a separate bowl add the eggs and whisk lightly then whisk in the corn syrup mixture.   Place the partially baked crust onto a rimmed baking sheet. Arrange the pecans on the bottom of the crust. Pour the corn syrup mixture over the pecans and transfer the baking sheet into the oven to bake until the filling is set about 50 minutes to 1 hour.  Allow to cool completely before serving.

Plum Galette,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Plum Galette,0 servings,  1 recipe Flaky Pie Dough 1 pound ripe black or red plums  1/3 cup granulated sugar 1  1/2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour 1 large egg beaten  2 tablespoons turbinado or sanding sugar   , A galette is a free-form tart that is shaped on a baking sheet - no tart pan needed. Known as crostata in Italy these hand-formed tarts are beautifully rustic and easy to shape and can be made with either sweet or savory filling. Galettes work best when made with a flaky-style dough which has enough strength to hold its shape and remain crisp while in contact with warm fruit juices.   Line baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.   Generously flour a work surface and place the chilled dough on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until the circle measures 14 inches wide and 1/8 inch thick. Starting at one edge roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer to prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and place a rack in the lower third.  Use a paring knife to cut and pit the plums; slice plums into  1/2-inch-thick wedges. Place the prepared fruit into a medium bowl and toss with granulated sugar and flour.    Mound the fruit mixture in the center of the chilled dough round leaving a 1  1/2-inch border. Fold the border up around the fruit pleating it to make a pretty circular enclosure and leaving the center open. Brush the top of the pleated dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle the turbinado sugar over the whole galette.  Bake galette until the crust is deep golden brown and fruit is bubbling 40 to 45 minutes. Use a metal spatula to lift the galette slightly and and check the underside of the crust which should be a beautiful brown color. Transfer to a rack to cool for 15 minutes.  To serve: Transfer the galette to a serving plate. Slice and serve warm accompanied by vanilla ice cream.

Sous Vide Burgers,ChefSteps,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Sous Vide Burgers,4 burgers,  900g Beef ground 20% fat recommended 50g Egg about 1 large Salt as needed Black pepper as needed   , This recipe was designed for use with the Joule Sous Vide by Chef Steps.  Heat Joule to133  degrees F / 56  degrees C : 133  degrees F / 56  degrees C will result in our favorite doneness-rosy in color and very juicy. If you like your burgers very rare opt for 126  degrees F / 52  degrees C. If you like your burger more done with just a hint of pink you can go as high as 158  degrees F / 70  degrees C.  Grind beef (optional): If you have the equipment grind your own beef. If you don't buy some.  Mix ground beef and egg: In a bowl combine ground beef and egg. (You can whip the egg up a little beforehand or just crack it into the bowl.) Using your hands or a spatula mix until egg is fully incorporated.  Portion patties: Use your scale to portion beef into 200 g patties.  Shape: To shape the patties we press the beef into a 4 in (105 mm) ring mold. This gives us perfectly consistent patties but it's not absolutely necessary. If you are not using a ring mold shape patties by first forming a ball to remove air and cracks. Next flatten the ball between flat palms using your thumbs to pinch the sides into shape.  Season: Just before cooking season patties with salt and pepper. Transfer to gallon-sized ziplock-style bags. We do two burgers per bag to avoid overcrowding.  Cook: Depending on how thick your patties are they will take anywhere from 15 minutes (for a 0.5 in / 1.3 cm thick patty) to 30 minutes (for a 1 in / 2.5 cm patty) to cook. You can leave them in the water for up to an hour however and they will still be perfect.  Do other stuff!: With sous vide there's no need to babysit your patties. You can leave them in the water while you set up some toppings switch out the playlist or shotgun some beers. Whenever you're ready to eat your burgers will be waiting.  Cool: Let burgers cool to room temperature while you prepare your platter of condiments. This will help them keep their shape when you sear.  Sear on a ripping-hot grill!: Transfer patties to a hot grill and sear 45 seconds. Flip add cheese if you want and sear for 30 more seconds. Cover and cook 15 additional seconds to melt cheese. NOTE: No grill? Not an issue. You can finish your burgers under the broiler or in a pan on the stove too.  Eat up: Congratulations friend. You will never eat an overcooked burger again. Top it off with your favorite burger toppins and enjoy!

Tequila and Lime-Marinated Chicken Skewers with Cilantro Sauce,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/appetizers/hot/Tequila and Lime-Marinated Chicken Skewers with Cilantro Sauce,4 servings,  Bamboo skewers  3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil  1/2 cup tequila 2 fresh limes juiced and zested  1 jalape&#241;o chile finely chopped  1 teaspoon paprika 2 teaspoons kosher salt 6 ounces skinless chicken breast cubed  1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 2 cups cilantro leaves 2 cups ice water  3/4 cup tequila 1 teaspoon garlic minced  1/2 cup canola oil plus 2 tablespoons for grilling Freshly ground black pepper   , By quickly blanching the cilantro leaves in salted boiling water and shocking the leaves in iced water you are preserving the bright green color from the chlorophyll contained in the herb. This technique is useful when making other herb and oil-based sauces.   If using bamboo skewers soak in water for at least 1 hour before using.  To make the marinade: In a large mixing bowl combine the olive oil tequila lime juice and zest chile paprika salt and chicken. Thoroughly mix the chicken in the marinade cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  To make the cilantro sauce: While the chicken is marinating prepare the cilantro sauce. Place a saucepan filled with water on the stove to boil. When the water is just starting to rapidly boil add the salt and blanch the cilantro leaves for 10 seconds and set the color. Immediately remove from the hot water and plunge in the ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain leaves and pat dry. Place the blanched cilantro in a blender with the tequila and garlic.

Corn Souffle with Red Pepper Sauce,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Corn Souffle with Red Pepper Sauce,6 to 7 servings,  Red Pepper Sauce: 1 (15-ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers 1 tablespoon water 1 teaspoon olive oil  1/8 teaspoon salt  Souffle: 3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons fine cornmeal  1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika  1/2 stick unsalted butter cut into pieces 1 teaspoon minced garlic (about 1 medium clove)  1 1/3 cups (10 1/2 ounces) whole milk 2 cups fresh corn kernels (about 3 ears)   3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil 1 teaspoon salt 5 large eggs separated plus 1 additional egg white  3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar   , Gorgeous golden and bursting with two kinds of corn-both fresh kernels and cornmeal-this souffle makes a great main course for a light summer dinner. The smoked paprika adds an intriguing undercurrent of flavor but if you don't have it on hand simply leave it out or substitute a pinch of cayenne. You can make this souffle during the winter and spring with frozen corn kernels but don't use dried basil; it tastes dusty and tired compared to the vibrant flavor of fresh basil. If fresh is unavailable omit it.  Make the sauce: In the strainer rinse the roasted peppers well under cold water. Pat dry with paper towels. Transfer to the bowl of the blender and add the water olive oil and salt. Blend until smooth 20 to 30 seconds. Set aside.   Make the bechamel: In the large bowl whisk together the flour cornmeal and paprika. Melt the butter in the medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook stirring occasionally until fragrant about 1 minute. Remove from the heat add the flour mixture and whisk well to remove any lumps. Return to the heat and cook for 1 to 2 minutes whisking constantly. Remove from the heat again and add the milk slowly whisking constantly to remove any lumps. Return to the heat and bring to a boil whisking constantly. Boil for 1 to 2 minutes then add the corn kernels and continue to cook for 3 to 4 minutes whisking until the sauce has thickened and the corn is cooked through. Remove from the heat and whisk in the Parmesan basil and salt. Whisk in the egg yolks and transfer to the large bowl. Set aside.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and position an oven rack in the bottom third. Generously butter the souffle dish (including the rim) coat it with finely grated Parmesan and tap out the excess.  Whip the egg whites: In the very clean bowl of the stand mixer whip the 6 egg whites and the cream of tartar on medium speed until they form firm peaks. You may also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl. Be careful not to overbeat. With the spatula gently stir one-fourth of the egg whites into the bechamel to lighten the mixture. Fold in the remaining whites just until there are no more streaks of whites.  Fill the dish and bake: Transfer the batter to the prepared baking dish and place on the baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake for 18 to 22 minutes longer until set and firm to the touch. While the souffle is baking transfer the red pepper sauce to the small saucepan and heat through. Serve the souffle immediately accompanied by the sauce.  Variation: To make individual corn souffle's prepare 7 (8-ounce) individual souffle dishes with butter and Parmesan as described above. Place the dishes on a baking sheet and evenly divide the souffle batter among them. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake for 7 to 10 minutes longer until firm to the touch.

Crispy Potatoes Anna – Pommes Anna,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Crispy Potatoes Anna – Pommes Anna,out 8 cups of sliced potatoes serving 6 people,   1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter 3 lbs. "boiling “potatoes (more if needed)  Paper towels A heavy cast-iron frying pan about 8" top diameter and 2 to 2 1/2" deep A heavy saucepan 7" bottom diameter or whatever will fit into the potato pan A heavy close-fitting cover for the potato pan A pizza tray or roasting pan to catch drippings A flexible-blade spatula If needed: a buttered baking sheet A lightly buttered hot serving dish  , Preliminaries: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Set one rack in very bottom level and another just above it. Clarify the butter: melt it skim off scum and spoon the clear liquid butter off the milky residue. Peel the potatoes; trim into cylinders about 1 3/4" in diameter so that you will have uniform slices then slice cylinders into even rounds  3/4" thick. You should have about 8 cups. Dry thoroughly in paper towels. (Do not wash potatoes after peeling because you want the starch to remain in so potatoes will mass more easily into a cake.) Arranging the potatoes in the dish: Pour  3/4" of the clarified butter into the pan and set over moderate heat. When hot start rapidly arranging the first layer of potatoes in the bottom of the pan as follows. Arrange one potato slice in the center of the pan. Overlap a circle of potato slices around it. Overlapping in the opposite (counter-clockwise) direction rapidly arrange a second circle around the first and continue with another (clockwise) overlapping circle if necessary to rim the edge of the pan. Pour on a spoonful of the clarified butter. Reversing direction again rapidly arrange an evenly overlapping layer of potatoes around circumference of pan fill in the center with more potatoes and baste with another spoonful of butter. Shake pan not too roughly by handle to be sure potatoes are not sticking and sprinkle on salt and pepper. Continue filling the pan with layers of potatoes basted with butter and seasoned with salt and pepper always being sure that the layer around the circumference of the pan is evenly spaced. Remember also to shake the pan by its handle from time to time to be sure potatoes are not sticking. Fill the pan completely allowing potatoes to form a  3/4 to  1/2" dome in the center; they will sink during cooking. You should have added enough butter so that you can see it bubbling up the sides of the pan; excess will be poured out after cooking. Baking: Butter bottom of saucepan and press it down hard on the potatoes forcing the layers together. Butter underside of cover place it on the potato pan set on upper of the two oven racks. Set drip pan under the potatoes on rack below to catch bubbling-up of butter (this could otherwise set fire to your oven). Bake for 20 minutes. Uncover press potatoes down hard again with bottom of saucepan and continue baking 20 to 25 minutes more uncovered. (If baked all the time with cover on potatoes tend to pick up an off taste.) Press down potatoes again before end of baking. Gently draw an edge of the potatoes away from side of dish: potatoes are done if brown and crusty. Bake 5 minutes or so more if necessary. Unmolding and serving: When potatoes are done place cover slightly askew on pan and drain out excess butter which may be used again in other cooking. Run spatula around edge of pan. Shake pan and if potatoes have stuck to bottom run spatula carefully under potatoes to loosen them but disturb them as little as possible. If you feel it will be easier to unmold them first onto a baking sheet and slide them onto the serving dish do so; otherwise invert the dish over the potato pan reverse the two and potatoes will drop onto dish. They should look like a brown cake.

Soak the salt cod in cold water for at least 24 hours changing the water two or three times. The cod should swell as it rehydrates. Sample a tiny piece. It should not taste unpleasantly salty when fully rehydrated. Drain well and pat dry with kitchen paper.  Cook the potatoes unpeeled in a pan of lightly salted boiling water for about 20 minutes until tender. Drain. As soon as they are cool enough to handle peel the potatoes then mash with a potato masher.  Pour the milk into a pan add half the green onions and bring to a simmer. Add the soaked cod and poach very gently for 10 to15 minutes or until it flakes easily. Remove the cod and flake it with a fork into a bowl discarding bones and skin.  Add 4 tablespoons of mashed potato to the cod and beat them together with a wooden spoon. Work in the olive oil then gradually add the remaining mashed potato. Beat in the remaining green onions and the parsley.  Season with lemon juice and pepper to taste-the mixture may also need a little salt but taste it before adding any. Add one egg to the mixture and beat it until thoroughly combined then chill until firm.  Shape the chilled fish mixture into 12 to 18 balls then gently flatten into small round cakes. Coat each one in flour then dip in the remaining beaten egg and coat with dried breadcrumbs. Chill until ready to fry.  Meanwhile make the aioli. Place the garlic and a good pinch of salt in a mortar and pound to a paste with a pestle. Using a small whisk or a wooden spoon gradually work in the egg yolks.  Beat in about half the olive oil a drop at a time. When the sauce is as thick as soft butter beat in 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Continue adding oil until the aioli is very thick. Season to taste adding more lemon juice if you wish.  Heat about  3/4 inch oil in a large heavy frying pan. Add the fritters and cook over a medium-high heat for about 4 minutes. Turn them over and cook for a further 4 minutes on the other side until crisp and golden. Drain on kitchen paper then serve with the aioli and lemon wedges.

Classic Crosshatch Peanut Butter Cookies,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Classic Crosshatch Peanut Butter Cookies,50 cookies,   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter softened  1/2 cup tightly packed light brown sugar  1/2 cup plus  1/3 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  3/4 cup creamy or chunky peanut butter at room temperature 1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon baking soda  3/4 teaspoon salt   , Whether you like your peanut butter cookies made with chunky peanut butter or smooth these classic cookies are rich and crumbly perfect with a glass of milk. The peanut is actually a legume that grows underground. It made its debut at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904 and has remained a beloved American food since then.  Position an oven rack in the top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.  Put the butter the brown sugar and the  1/2 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl. Using a mixer beat on low speed for 1 minute. Turn up the speed to medium and beat for another minute. The mixture should be blended and smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on low speed until well blended. Add the peanut butter and beat until well blended. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Put the flour baking soda and salt in a medium bowl and whisk until blended. Add the dry ingredients to the batter and beat on low speed just until the dough is smooth and no patches of flour are visible. Scrape down the bowl one last time and make sure no clumps of flour are hiding in the bottom.  Use an ice-cream scoop to shape the dough into cookies. You can also shape the dough by measuring out 1 level tablespoon for each cookie and then rolling the dough between your palms into a ball. Space the balls about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.  Use a fork to press down firmly on top of each ball once in each direction to form a crisscross pattern.  Place one baking sheet on each oven rack. Bake for 5 minutes then switch the pans between the oven racks. Bake for another 6 to 7 minutes until the cookies are golden brown around the edges. Transfer the pans to the cooling racks and let the cookies cool completely. You may need to reuse the pans to finish baking all the cookies. Let the pans cool before you put more dough on them for baking. Store the cookies in an airtight container or a resealable plastic bag for 5 days.   
Cappuccino Biscotti with Hazelnuts and Chocolate,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Cappuccino Biscotti with Hazelnuts and Chocolate,45 cookies,  1 1/2 tablespoons instant espresso powder 2 teaspoons warm water 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter softened (65&deg; to 68&deg;F)  2/3 cup (4 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar 3 large eggs at room temperature 2 3/4 cups (13 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup (4 1/2 ounces) chopped skinned toasted hazelnuts 5 ounces good-quality semisweet or bittersweet chocolate cut into  3/4-inch chunks or 1 cup (6 1/2 ounces) mini chocolate chips  1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) superfine sugar  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)   , Biscotti-twice-baked super-crunchy Italian favorites-are made for dunking into a steaming cup of coffee tea or hot chocolate. They can often be too hard to enjoy out of hand though. This particular style of biscotti with a bit of butter added for additional flavor and a softer texture is great for snacking whether dipped or dunked.  They are good make-ahead cookies and keep well in an airtight container for weeks. Theoretically. You probably won't be able to keep them around long enough to find out. Many variations can be made from this recipe by leaving out the espresso powder changing the nuts to almonds walnuts or pistachios adding  1/2 cup of dried fruit (such as raisins or cranberries) and leaving out or changing the type of chocolate chips.   Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center.  Mix the dough: In the small bowl stir together the espresso powder and warm water until the powder is dissolved. Set aside.  Place the butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer and beat on medium speed until smooth and slightly lightened in color 2 to 3 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl although you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Add the espresso mixture and blend well. Scrape down the bowl with the spatula. Add the eggs one at a time beating well (15 to 20 seconds) and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.  In the medium bowl whisk together the flour baking powder and salt. Add to the butter mixture all at once. Turn the mixer to the lowest speed and blend slowly just until there are no more patches of flour. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl.  Add the hazelnuts and chocolate chips and mix on low just until blended. Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir gently a few times with the spatula to make sure the nuts and chips are evenly distributed and there are no patches of unincorporated flour or butter lurking near the bottom of the bowl.  Shape and bake the dough: Divide the dough in half. On a work surface lightly dusted with flour gently squeeze and roll each piece to shape into logs about 13 inches long. Line one baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the logs on the sheet about 4 inches apart. Press down on the logs flattening them slightly until they are each about 2 inches across the top. Place the second baking sheet under the first (to prevent the bottoms of the logs from browning too quickly). Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until the logs are firm to the touch and lightly golden brown. Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and let the logs cool completely. (If you attempt to slice them while warm the chocolate will smear and the cookies will look messy.)  Cut the logs and bake them a second time: Turn the oven down to 275&deg;F and position two racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven. Carefully transfer the cookie logs to a cutting surface. Use the serrated knife to slice the logs on a slight diagonal into cookies  1/8 inch thick. Line the second baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the cookies cut side down on the parchment-lined sheets (you'll need both sheets to hold all the cookies). Toast the cookies in the oven switching the sheets between the racks and rotating each front to back halfway through for 30 to 40 minutes until dry and lightly tinged with color. Transfer to a cooling rack.  While the cookies are toasting prepare the finishing sugar if you like. Whisk together the superfine sugar and cinnamon in the cleaned medium bowl. As soon as the cookies are out of the oven and on the rack immediately roll them in the cinnamon sugar and return to the baking sheet to cool completely.  Storing: The cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 months. If the cookies soften during storage re-crisp them

Rhubarb Raspberry Rye Crumble,Seven Spoons,home/recipes/desserts/crisps-crumbles/Rhubarb Raspberry Rye Crumble,1 serving,  Streusel topping:  1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter softened  1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar  3/4 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt 1 cup (110 g) old-fashioned rolled oats  1/2 cup (65 g) all-purpose flour  1/2 cup (50 g) rye flour  3/4 cup (20 g) flaked almonds  3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom  Filling: 2 pounds (905 g) rhubarb trimmed and cut into  1/2-inch (1.3 cm) pieces 1 3/4 pounds (565 g) raspberries fresh or frozen Juice from  1/2 lemon (about 2 tablespoon)   3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar (see Note)   3/4 cup (28 g) tapioca flour  3/4 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt 1 vanilla bean Vanilla frozen yogurt or whipped cream to serve   ,  Behind the house where my mother-in-law grew up is a rhubarb plant that as I was told by her father "has been in our family forever." He told me the variety was called Strawberry Rhubarb and is one that is especially good for baking.  There are four rhubarb plants in the far corner of my own yard grown from that original. Viewed from the window above the kitchen sink they form a green rustling mound with their built-in parasol of leaves sheltering carmine stems. They thrive beside raspberry bushes also started in my husband’s grandparents’ garden.  A level of sentimentality for the combination is thus inevitable yet the pairing of rhubarb and raspberry is undeniably good on the table. I prefer raspberries to strawberries with rhubarb; they seem to stand up to the strident assertiveness of the stalks better plus I think raspberries take better to baking.  Here the garden’s yield is baked to a heady burgundy compote beneath the earthy cover of rye streusel. That topping is almost a shortbread dough which makes for a buttery complement to the knife-sharp jammy filling.  Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) with a rack in the lower third of the oven. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Grease a 2-quart (2 L) baking dish with butter.  To make the topping in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream together the butter sugar and salt on medium-high speed until fluffy around 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and turn the speed to low. Sprinkle in the oats flours almonds and cardamom; let the machine run until the dry ingredients are incorporated and the mixture starts to gather into a rough streusel 3 to 5 minutes scraping down the bowl as needed. Keep in a cool spot or covered in the fridge while you organize the filling.  To make the filling in a large bowl combine the rhubarb raspberries lemon juice sugar tapioca flour and salt. Split the vanilla bean down its length scrape the seeds into the bowl and then add the pod as well. Fold everything until the tapioca disappears. Tip the fruit into the prepared baking dish including any collected juices. With clean hands crumble the streusel over the filling in haphazard and uneven heaps.  Place the dish on the prepared baking sheet and bake until the juices are gurgling with large bubbles and the topping is golden brown 50 minutes or thereabouts.  Cool on a rack for 30 minutes before considering eating. Serve warm or cold with vanilla frozen yogurt or whipped cream.  NOTE: The sugar for the filling may be scant for some tastes; both rhubarb and raspberries are sour and the amount used here keeps the twang that hits the point at the back of your jaw right below the ear-it’s not so much that the muscle clenches but there’s still a twitch. When I eat the filling with the crumble topping I feel it all evens out but still it is a characteristic to know before going in.  Reprinted from Seven Spoons by Tara O’Brady.

Lamb Tagine with Artichoke Hearts Dried Apricots and Preserved Lemon,Things Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Marie Simmons photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Lamb Tagine with Artichoke Hearts Dried Apricots and Preserved Lemon,6 servings,  2 to 2 1/2 pounds trimmed boneless lamb shoulder or lamb shank cut into 1-inch chunks 2 teaspoons coarse salt  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups  3/4-inch-thick yellow onion wedges 10 saffron threads 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground ginger  1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 1 cup peeled sliced ( 3/4-inch) carrot 1 cinnamon stick 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth or water plus more as needed 1 cup drained canned italian plum tomatoes cut into 1-inch chunks 2 stems italian parsley plus 1 tablespoon finely chopped 2 stems cilantro plus 1 tablespoon finely chopped 4 artichokes preferably with stems or 1 (10-ounce box) frozen artichoke hearts 1 lemon halved 4 ounces (about 1 cup) dried apricot halves 2 tablespoons chopped preserved lemon rind 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint   , Lamb artichokes and dried fruit are a classic combination for a Moroccan tagine but it is the bouquet of spices-saffron cumin ginger coriander cinnamon-that make this dish memorable. To savor the wonderful flavors in the sauce spoon the tagine onto mounds of fluffy couscous (page 317). This recipe calls for browning the lamb which you can do in a tagine if it is has a stainless steel–clad or castiron base. If your tagine is all earthenware simply toss the meat with the ingredients and simmer in the tagine over low heat. Alternatively brown the meat in a skillet and transfer it to the tagine for simmering or prepare the entire dish in a Dutch oven or braiser.  Place the lamb in a large bowl sprinkle with the salt and pepper and toss to coat evenly. Set aside.  Heat a stainless steel–clad or cast-iron base of a tagine  over medium-low heat and add the olive oil. When the oil is hot  enough to sizzle a piece of onion increase the heat to medium  add the onion wedges and cook stirring for 10 minutes or until  they wilt and begin to turn color. Meanwhile in a small bowl stir together the saffron cumin ginger and coriander.  Add the meat carrot and cinnamon to the onion increase the heat to medium-high and cook stirring constantly for 5 minutes or until the meat begins to brown. Add the chicken broth tomatoes parsley and cilantro stems and the saffron mixture and bring to a boil.  Place the lid on the tagine decrease the heat to low and cook without disturbing the cover for 1 1/2 hours adjusting the heat to keep the stew at a gentle simmer.  Meanwhile if using fresh artichoke hearts fill a medium bowl half full with water; squeeze the juice from a lemon half into the water and add the spent lemon half to the water. Working with 1 artichoke at a time pull the leaves back and tear them off where they meet at the base (bottom) until you reach the pale green inner leaves. (Reserve the leaves for another use.) Turn the artichoke on its side on a cutting board and with a chef's knife cut the attached leaves off just where they meet the base. Cut the stem off the base and reserve. With a paring knife trim the dark green outer layer from the base. With the tip of a spoon scoop the fuzzy portion from the center and discard. Rub the trimmed artichoke bottom with the remaining lemon half. Cut the bottom into quarters and add to the lemon water. Peel the fibrous outer layer from the stem and cut crosswise into  1/2-inch lengths. Add to the lemon water. Repeat with the remaining artichokes.  After 1 1/2 hours test the meat for tenderness. It should be fork-tender. If it isn't simmer it a little longer and test again.  When the meat is tender drain the fresh artichokes and add them or add the frozen artichoke hearts and the apricots. Re-cover and cook for 30 minutes or until the fresh artichokes are tender or only 10 minutes if using frozen artichoke hearts. Stir in the preserved lemon.  If the stew is swimming in liquid use a slotted spoon to transfer the solids to a bowl cover with aluminum foil and place in an oven set at 200&deg;F. Boil the liquid uncovered for 10 minutes or until reduced slightly. Return the solids to the tagine.  Sprinkle the finely chopped parsley cilantro and mint over the top. Re-cover the tagine and carry it to the table. uncover and serve.

Chocolate Souffles,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Chocolate Souffles,8 servings, Chocolate Souffles  6 ounces semisweet chocolate 6 large eggs  3/4 cup sugar divided use plus more for ramekins  3/4 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons heavy (whipping) cream  1 teaspoon vanilla Espresso Creme Anglaise recipe follows A little powdered sugar for sprinkling on top   Espresso Creme Anglaise  1 cup heavy cream 1 vanilla bean split and scraped 4 large egg yolks   1/2 cup sugar 1 cup brewed espresso coffee |2 tablespoons instant espresso powder   , Place rack in middle of oven and turn on to 350 degrees F. Butter eight 6-ounce individual souffle dishes.  Sprinkle inside of each with a bit of sugar tipping to coat evenly.  Set on baking sheet.    Place chocolate in a heat proof bowl and set over a pot of simmering water.  Do not let the bottom of the pot come into contact with the water.  Heat until chocolate melts.  Remove from heat and set aside while you make the base  Make souffle base:  Separate eggs placing yolks in one mixer bowl and whites in another.  Add  1/2 cup of the sugar and the salt to the egg yolks.  Beat with mixer on medium-high speed until very light fluffy and thick-about 3 minutes.  (Mixture should be so thick that when you lift turned-off beaters an egg yolk "ribbon" falls that takes 3 to 4 seconds to dissolve.)  Set aside.    Stir cream and vanilla into the melted chocolate.  Stir in  1/3 of the egg yolk mixture.  Fold in remaining egg yolk mixture in 2 additions.  Set aside.    Beat egg whites with mixer on medium speed until fluffy but not stiff -3 to 4 minutes.  Sprinkle in remaining 1 tablespoon of the sugar.  Beat 1 minute longer on medium speed-until whites are shiny and firm but not stiff.  (Beaten whites should form a soft peak -looks like top of a Dairy Queen ice cream cone-when turned-off beaters are lifted out.)  Stir  1/3 of egg whites into chocolate base.  Gently fold in remaining egg whites in 2 additions.  Divide evenly among prepared souffle molds.  At this point you can refrigerate the souffles for several hours before baking but then they will need to bake longer (20 to 23 minutes).    Bake and serve:  Place molds on baking sheet in middle of oven and set timer for 15 minutes.  Don't open oven during baking.  When timer goes off souffles should be puffed and cracked on top.  When you gently shake the baking sheet souffles should jiggle only slightly (when you spoon out the center to eat it should be creamy).  If souffles are really loose quickly close oven and bake 2 to 3 minutes longer.  Serve immediately-before the souffles begin to fall have each guest crack open the top of the souffle with a spoon and pour in the Espresso Creme Anglaise. Dust the top with confectioners' sugar.   Espresso Creme Anglaise  Pour the heavy cream and vanilla bean and seeds into a saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Bring the mixture to a brief simmer until bubbles form around the edge of the pot; do not boil. Remove from heat. Discard the vanilla bean. The vanilla bean can be rinsed and dried and kept for another use.  In a large bowl whisk together the egg yolks sugar coffee and espresso powder until well blended. Temper the yolks by gradually whisking in the hot cream mixture (do not add too quickly or the eggs will cook.) Return the custard back to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat stirring constantly until it's thick enough to coat the back of a spoon about 8 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately with Chocolate Souffles. (If not serving immediately press plastic wrap on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate.)

Caramelized Onion and Goat Cheese Tart with Red Pepper Foam,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/Caramelized Onion and Goat Cheese Tart with Red Pepper Foam,32 servings, Pastry dough  1  3/4 sticks (10 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter 2 cups all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon salt 2 to 4 tablespoons ice water Pie weights or raw rice for weighting shells   Filling  10 ounces soft mild goat cheese (about 1 heaping cup) softened 1 stick ( 1/2 cup) unsalted butter softened  3/4cup sour cream 3 large eggs 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 3 onions (about 1  1/2 pounds total)  2 tablespoons olive oil   Red pepper foam garnish  3 red bell peppers  1 cup chicken stock  2 each gelatin sheets  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper    , Foam is a culinary technique consisting of natural flavors such as fruit juices mixed with a gelling or stabilizing agent such as agar or lecithin and either whipped with a handheld immersion blender or extruded through a whipped cream canister equipped with N2O cartridges. Foams have been described as " airy " with the flavor taking precedence over the substance it is suspended in. Foams allow cooks to integrate new flavors without changing the physical composition of a dish. To make these tarts two 13  1/2 x 4 x 1-inch tart pans with removable rims are ideal; however you could also use one 11 x 1-inch round tart pan with a removable rim. Make dough and filling: Cut butter into bits and in a bowl with a pastry blender or in a food processor blend or pulse together with flour and salt until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2 tablespoons ice water and toss with a fork or pulse until incorporated. Add enough remaining ice water 1 tablespoon at a time tossing with fork or pulsing to incorporate to form a dough. On a work surface smear dough with heel of hand in 3 or 4 forward motions to make dough easier to work with. Divide dough in half and pat each half into a rectangle about 6 by 3 inches. Chill rectangles wrapped separately in plastic wrap at least 1 hour and up to 1 week. Thinly slice onions and in a large skillet cook with salt to taste in oil covered over moderate heat stirring occasionally 10 minutes or until softened. Cook onions uncovered stirring until golden and any liquid in skillet is evaporated. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface roll out 1 dough rectangle into a 16 x 6-inch rectangle and fit it into a 13  1/2 x 4 x 1-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim. Roll a rolling pin over pastry to trim it flush with top of rim and prick bottom of shell in several places with a fork. Make 1 more tart shell in another tart pan in same manner. Line shells with foil and fill with pie weights or raw rice. Bake shells in middle of oven  for 10 minutes. Carefully remove foil and weights or rice and bake shells until pale golden about 5 minutes more. While shells are baking whisk together goat cheese butter and sour cream until smooth and whisk in eggs until combined well. Season custard with salt and pepper. Spread onions evenly in shells and pour custard over onions. Sprinkle thyme over custard and bake tarts in middle of oven 20 minutes or until puffed and golden. Cool tarts in pans on racks (filling will deflate). Tarts may be made 2 days ahead cooled completely in pans and chilled covered in pans. Reheat tarts in pans uncovered in a 350°F. oven about 15 minutes to crisp crusts. Remove rims from pans. Cut tarts crosswise into  3/4-inch-wide slices to make about 32 hors d'oeuvres.   Serve warm or at room temperature. Red pepper foam garnish Roast peel and seed peppers. Puree.  Bring stock to a boil and add pepper puree season with salt and pepper. Bloom gelatine in cold water for 7 minutes. Squeeze out excess water and add to stock to dissolve. Strain and season with salt and pepper chill mixture over an ice bath.

To dry brine turkey: Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Place the turkey into a roasting pan and run your hand or handle of a wooden spoon gently between the skin and meat to loosen the skin being careful not to tear it. Loosen as much skin as possible over the breasts legs and thighs. Rub the meat under the skin with salt to coat the meat evenly again taking care not to rip the skin. Transfer turkey uncovered to the bottom shelf of the refrigerator for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours.   To dress and roast turkey: Remove turkey from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and place a rack in the lower third. To a small bowl add butter and herbs; stir to combine. Rub the turkey with the butter mixture coating all parts equally. If needed gently stretch skin to cover breast meat completely.

Scatter onion carrot and celery pieces across bottom of roasting pan stirring to coat with pan juices. Return turkey to oven and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F 2 hours or more depending on the weight of the turkey. General rule for roasting poultry is to roast it for 15 to 20 minutes per pound.  Remove turkey from oven and transfer to a large platter. Tent turkey loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm and rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes before carving.  Strain pan drippings through a fine-mesh strainer set over a heatproof vessel making sure to scrape off all browned bits from bottom of roasting pan. Once cool fat can be skimmed off and saved for other recipes; save the drippings for making the gravy.  To serve: Using a carving knife remove legs and thighs from the turkey. Slice breasts into  3/4-inch slices and place on a serving platter with legs and thighs. Serve immediately.

There is a lot of cream in this recipe but its addition and a little sherry distinguish bisque from other seafood soups.   Be sure to purchase shrimp with their shells because the shells add tremendous flavor to the soup especially when using quick-and-easy store-bought seafood stock. Some old recipes for bisque go so far as to pulverize the shells and stir them into the simmering soup but in this recipe they are left whole and strained out after they work their magic.  Peel the shrimp and reserve the shells.  In a large saucepan over medium-high heat warm the oil. Stir in the shallot and leek and cook until tender about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Deglaze the pot with the sherry stirring to loosen the fond from the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomato paste and cook stirring constantly until fragrant and one shade darker in color about 1 minute. Sprinkle in the flour and cook stirring constantly 2 minutes. Do not let the flour brown.  Whisk in the stock. Bring to a simmer and let cook until the liquid is reduced by half about 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard the solids then return the liquid to the pan and bring to a simmer. Whisk in the warm cream and sherry (if using).  Stir in the shrimp and simmer until the shrimp are opaque about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot garnished with parsley and a drizzle of sherry if using.

Sous Vide New York Steak,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Sous Vide New York Steak,4 servings,  4 ( 1/2-pound) New York strip steaks 2 tablespoons olive oil divided Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (gallon) Ziploc bags    , If you have been to a fine-dining restaurant in the last 5 years or so chances are you have most likely been served some form of protein cooked in a water bath sous-vide style. The process of vacuum sealing the meat and cooking it in a precise temperature-controlled water bath has revolutionized the way many restaurants operate.   Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device's owner's manual for proper food-handling and safety procedures.   Choose a pot large enough to hold your food with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach your sous vide circulator to the side of the pot and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.  Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator turning the silver temperature ring above the display to 132 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.  Season the steaks lightly with 1 tablespoon of oil salt and pepper. Place the steak into a Ziploc bag so that the bottom of the steak is flat along the bottom of the bag. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the meat. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag and leave the steak to circulate in the water until the steak is medium-rare about 40 minutes; medium about 45 to 48 minutes; medium-well about 48 to 55 minutes.  Remove the steak from the bag and pat-dry with paper-towels. Place a large nonstick skillet on the stove over moderate-high heat add the remaining oil. When the oil is shimmering using tongs carefully add the steak and quickly sear on both sides until brown about 1 minute per side.   To serve: Immediately transfer the steak to warmed dinner plates and serve immediately. No resting required.   
Infused Pasta,by ;Sicily: The Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Infused Pasta,about 1 1/2 pounds dough (6 servings pasta),  About  1/2 pound parsley stems and leaves (to make about 1 cup parsley puree) or  1/2 pound carrots (prepared as stated below)  Salt  1/2 pound 00 flour  1/2 pound remilled semola flour About 3/4 cup room temperature water   , In Sicily it is not common to flavor fresh pasta at home. However nowadays more and more restaurants are including dishes prepared with pastas flavored with Sicilian tastes and aromas. With an abundance of wild greens that grow at Feudo Montoni I'm always looking for ways to utilize vegetables in creative ways. This recipe flavors pasta with parsley but you could easily substitute any other leafy green such as spinach chard mustard greens borage nettles and/or basil. If you would like to flavor the pasta with a non-leafy vegetable such as carrots or beets first peel the vegetables cut them into chunks and cook them in boiling salted water until tender and easily pierced with a paring knife. Puree the vegetable pieces in a food processor then pass the puree through a fine-mesh strainer to rid it of any lumps.   To make the flavoring puree lightly blanch the parsley stems and leaves (or carrot pieces) in boiling salted water for about 1 minute. The salt helps to retain the color of the leaves. Do not overcook or the leaves will lose their color. Strain the parsley out of the boiling water and make sure to drain off all the water. One way to remove the water is by placing the blanched parsley in cheesecloth and squeezing out the water by hand.    Puree the leaves and stems in a food processor and pass them through a fine-mesh strainer to rid the puree of any lumps or fibrous pieces.    To incorporate the vegetable pulp with the two flours it's best to use a stand mixer with a hook attachment. First place the puree in the mixer along with the room-temperature water and 1 teaspoon salt. Add the two types of flour little by little mixing them in until the dough forms a ball. The dough should be smooth and elastic in texture. If the dough feels too dry and is not fully sticking together add a touch more water. If the dough feels too wet and pasty add some more flour of either variety. In either case add a little at a time. Form the dough into a ball cover it with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for about 1 hour at room temperature.    Roll the dough and shape it into the cut of your choice such as spaghetti tagliolini or tagliatelle  Reprinted from Sicily: The Cookbook: Recipes Rooted in Traditions by Melissa Muller.

Warm Cranberry Crumble Tart,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Warm Cranberry Crumble Tart,1 serving,  Flaky pie or tart dough: Click here for recipe »  Filling: 5 cups (20 ounces) fresh cranberries  3/4 cup (5 3/4 ounces) sugar Finely grated zest of 1 medium orange 4 teaspoons unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  Topping: 1 cup (5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 cup (5 3/4 ounces) sugar  3/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces Vanilla ice cream for serving   , When the crisp fall air brings fresh cranberries to market this tart will celebrate the season. Dressy enough for company comforting enough for a night in front of the fire it should be served warm with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream alongside. The sweet crumble topping is a fine partner to the tart cranberries within. If you'd like to add a little more crunch stir 1/3 cup coarsely chopped nuts into the crumble topping (walnuts and almonds would be especially good).  Trim and finish the tart dough: Use the scissors to trim the dough so it overhangs the edge of the tart pan by 1 inch. Moisten the inside wall of dough with your finger dipped in cool water. Fold the overhanging dough inward to form a sturdy double-layered edge. Press firmly with your thumbs to fuse the two layers of dough then roll your thumb over the rim of the tart to remove any excess dough there. Chill while the oven preheats.  Bake the shell: Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F and position an oven rack in the lower third. Line the chilled tart shell with heavy-duty foil pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 20 to 22 minutes until the foil comes away from the dough easily (if it doesn't bake another 5 to 6 minutes and check again). Remove the pan from the oven (hold the pan by the sides and not the bottom) close the oven door and lift out the foil and weights from the shell; set them aside to cool. Return the pan to the oven to continue baking the shell for about 10 minutes then remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and check to see if any cracks have formed. If you see a crack very gently smear a tiny bit of reserved dough over the crack to patch it&#45;you need only enough to seal the opening. Return the pan to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer until the crust is a nice golden brown all over. Transfer to a rack and cool completely.  Mix the filling: Coarsely chop half of the cranberries by hand with a chef's knife or with a few pulses in the bowl of the food processor. In the medium bowl combine the chopped cranberries whole cranberries sugar orange zest flour and cinnamon and stir to blend well.   Use a silicone or rubber spatula to scrape the filling into the cooled tart shell.  Mix the topping: Place the flour sugar and salt in the bowl of the stand mixer. Add the cold butter and mix on medium-low speed until the mixture begins to form clumps the size of small peas (some will still look a little sandy which is fine). This step may also be done by hand in the cleaned medium bowl pinching the butter between your fingers or cutting it with a pastry blender until small clumps form.  Cover the filling evenly with the topping.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350&deg;F and bake the tart for 40 minutes until the fruit is soft and bubbling and the topping is golden brown. Transfer to a cooling rack making sure you hold the pan by the sides and not the bottom (remember it's a two-piece pan and can come apart!). Cool for 20 minutes before serving. Or cool completely then reheat just before serving.  Place the tart pan on top of a large can from your pantry (the 28-ounce tomato cans are good) so that the bottom balances midair as the rim falls to the counter. Use the large metal spatula to transfer the tart to a serving plate or simply leave the bottom of the tart pan under the tart for support. Slice the tart with a thin sharp knife and serve warm with vanilla ice cream.  Storing: The tart keeps for 1 day at room temperature. For longer storage cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Allow 1 hour for the tart to come to room temperature or reheat in a 350&deg;F oven for 12 to 15 minutes

Honey-Glazed Carrots,Sansaire,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Honey-Glazed Carrots,1 serving,  16 young carrots peeled  3/4 cup unsalted butter cubed 2 tbsp honey  1/2 tsp cinnamon  3/4 cup roasted hazelnuts coarsely chopped  3/4 cup Greek yogurt or creme fra&#238;che (optional) Flaky sea salt to taste Fresh herbs chopped for garnishment   , Choose a container large enough to hold your food with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the container using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator turning the silver temperature ring above the display to 185 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.   Place the carrots butter honey and cinnamon into a Ziploc bag or divide into multiple bags so the carrots fit into a single layer. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the carrots. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag and leave the carrots to cook in the water until tender 45 minutes.  To Serve: Optionally spread a thin layer of greek yogurt or creme fra&#238;che onto your serving plates. Using tongs carefully remove the carrots from the Ziploc bag and place atop the yogurt. Drizzle the liquid contents of the bag over the carrots. Finish with a sprinkle of chopped roasted hazelnuts and flaky sea salt.

The trick to a terrific bouillabaisse is creating a complex and flavorful broth while not overcooking the delicate seafood.  For the aioli: In the bowl of a food processor combine the roasted red pepper garlic bread egg yolk Dijon lemon juice salt and pepper. While the food processor is running slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer aioli to a small serving bowl and set aside. Place a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add oil. Add shallot leek and fennel and saute stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon until softened about 5 minutes. Add garlic orange zest fennel and bay leaf; cook until aromatic about 1 minute.   Deglaze pan with Pernod and add saffron and tomatoes; cook until fragrant and to allow the flavors of the spices to develop about 5 minutes. Add fish broth and potatoes; bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium and simmer. Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon until flavors meld about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. (To make ahead prepare the stew up to this step and store refrigerated. About 20 minutes before serving return broth to a simmer and proceed with the recipe.)   For the grilled bread: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Rub sliced bread with halved garlic and brush lightly with olive oil. Grill bread until slightly charred around the edges and well grill marked. Transfer to a platter or bowl and cover with a clean towel or foil to keep warm.        To finish bouillabaisse: To the simmering broth over medium-high heat add mussels and clams; stir then cover and cook for 2 minutes. Add fish and shrimp; stir and cover. When the stew returns to a simmer and seafood is just cooked through about 5 minutes remove from heat.   Discard any unopened mussels or clams. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Chop 2 tablespoons of fennel fronds and stir into stew. (Reheat stew as needed but note seafood will toughen with prolonged cooking.)    To serve: Traditionally bouillabaisse is served by placing the toasted bread in individual bowls and ladling seafood and broth over. For a slightly lighter version ladle and arrange an even portion of seafood and broth into serving bowls top each with a teaspoon of aioli and serve with the grilled bread and extra aioli on the side.

Oaxacan Chicken Tamales with Chile Rojo Salsa,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Oaxacan Chicken Tamales with Chile Rojo Salsa,g for about 3 dozen tamales,  4 ounces dried Guajillo chile peppers 1 cup water 1 (14-ounce) can fire-roasted tomatoes 1 teaspoon cumin seeds toasted 1 teaspoon coriander seeds toasted 1 tablespoon dried oregano 4 large garlic cloves 1 rotisserie chicken skin and bones removed meat shredded  2 bay leaves Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Fresh lime juice Chile Rojo Salsa (recipe follows)   , To a large skillet set over medium heat add the chiles and toast turning often until skins begin to blister and chiles are fragrant about 2 minutes. Using tongs transfer the chiles to a cutting board and remove stems and seeds.   Transfer the chiles to the bowl of a blender or food processor fitted with a metal blade and add water tomatoes spices and garlic. Process until the mixture is smooth about 1 minute.  Return the sauce to the skillet set over medium-high heat and add chicken and bay leaves. Bring the sauce to a boil then reduce the heat and simmer until reduced to a sauce-like consistency about 20 minutes. Discard bay leaves taste and adjust seasoning with salt pepper and lime juice.  Open a bag of husks and soak them in hot water for at least 30 minutes before making tamales. Weigh them down with a pan or heavy plate to keep them submerged. Rinse to remove any dust or silks and stack them in a large mixing bowl covered with a clean damp kitchen towel.  There are many ways to wrap tamales including a single tie or a double tie. The easiest and fastest way to wrap tamales is to fold them on three sides and place in the steamer open ends up without tying.   To assemble the tamales lay the corn husk flat rough side down and the tip pointing away from you. If it’s a small husk place two together overlapping them a bit. Spread about  1/3 cup masa preparada (recipe follows) in the center of the bottom part of the husk using moistened fingers or the back of a spoon smooth dough to about a  1/3-inch thickness. Top with 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling. Fold the two long sides of the husk towards the middle so that the masa forms a tube around the filling. Fold the pointed tip of the husk down over the filled section. The filling end will be exposed but the masa will set and protect it during steaming.  Place the tamales in the pot or steamer standing upright or stack them by placing one layer facing in one direction and the next at a 90 degree angle leaving space for steam to circulate around each. Place the lid on the pot/steamer and bring the water to a steady simmer. Watch the pot for water level and top of with additional water as needed. Keep a pot of boiling water on the stove to add as needed to the steamer. Check for doneness after about 1 hour by peeling back the husk. If it comes off smoothly and the masa is firm you tamale is done. If not rewrap it and place it back in the steamer. Depending on the size and quantity of the tamales cooking time can take up to 90 minutes. Pressure cookers can steam tamales in about 20 minutes saving lots of time. However calculate how many tamales will fit in your pressure cooker first to determine how many batches you will need to pressure cook. For large quantities of tamales a large steamer pot setup may be preferable to a pressure cooker in regards to timing.     To serve: Remove tamales from husks spoon salsa over the top and serve immediately.  
Instant Pot Buffalo Ranch Wings,Rebecca White A Pleasant Little Kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Instant Pot Buffalo Ranch Wings,approximately 28 hot wings,  3 pounds chicken drumettes 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 cup water Buffalo ranch sauce see recipe below Fresh chopped chives for topping   For the Buffalo Ranch Sauce:   3/4 cup hot sauce 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoon honey  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons shallots finally chopped 2 tablespoons fresh chives finally chopped 4 garlic cloves finally chopped 1 tablespoon buttermilk  , Combine the two favorite elements of hot wings buffalo sauce and ranch and you have yourself a new favorite appetizer: buffalo ranch hot wings. Buttermilk fresh chives shallots and honey are combined with a homemade buffalo sauce to add a bit of ranch flavor. These wings are steamed inside the Instant Pot with a Joseph Joseph Lotus Steamer chilled in the fridge tossed in a homemade wing sauce and then finished off in the oven.   30 minutes before cook time remove the wings from the fridge and evenly salt the wings on all sides. Let the wings sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Pour the water into the Instant Pot and place the Joseph Joseph Lotus Steamer into the Instant Pot insert. Place the wings inside the steamer and secure the lid on to the Instant Pot Using the steam function steam the wings on high-pressure for 10 minutes. Use the quick pressure release method to release the steam after 10 minutes of cooking. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels.

Lemon Curd,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/dessert-sauces/Lemon Curd,2 1/2 cups,  3 large eggs 3 large egg yolks 1 cup minus 1 tablespoon (6 1/2 ounces) sugar  3/4 cup (6 ounces) strained freshly squeezed lemon juice 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces   , The pastry kitchen would be incomplete without the tart tangy freshness of lemon curd. Use it to flavor soufflés; to fill thumbprint cookies tarts cakes and turnovers; to dollop on scones and biscuits and alongside cake slices; to spoon over fresh berries; to fold into whipped cream; and even to spread on morning toast. One taste and you'll be starting your list as well.  Fill the large bowl halfway with ice and water and set it aside. Fill the bottom of the double boiler with 2 inches of water and bring to a rolling boil. Check to see that the water is at least 2 inches below the top portion of the double boiler.  Place the eggs egg yolks and sugar into the top of the double boiler (off the heat) and whisk until blended. Add the lemon juice and mix well. Reduce the heat until the water is at a gentle boil. Place the egg mixture over the water and cook whisking constantly but leisurely and scraping the edges frequently so the eggs don't scramble there until the curd is very thick about 7 minutes. A finished curd should hold its shape; when the whisk is lifted and a bit of curd falls back into the bowl it should remain distinct on the surface rather than blending back into the mixture and should register about 180&deg;F on the thermometer. Do not let the curd boil or you will have bits of scrambled egg in your curd (if this happens quickly remove the bowl from the heat and continue to the next step).  Immediately strain the curd through the strainer set over the medium bowl. Use the spatula to push the curd through the strainer leaving behind any bits of scrambled egg. Add the cold butter pieces to the curd burying them so they melt quickly. Wait 1 minute then whisk until the butter is completely melted and blended with the curd. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the curd then set the medium bowl in the large bowl of ice water. Once the curd has completely cooled use or store in the refrigerator until needed.  Storing: The lemon curd may be prepared up to 3 days in advance and should be consumed within 5 days. Keep the curd refrigerated in an airtight container with a piece of plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming.

To test seasoning cook a teaspoon of the filling in a small skillet until cooked through. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.  To assemble dumplings: Lay one wrapper on a clean work surface and place a teaspoon of filling just below the center of the wrapper. Using a small pastry brush or a fingertip brush a thin film of cold water around the edge of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half over the filling and pinch it shut just at the midpoint. Pleat one open side towards the center using three pleats to close. Repeat on the other side aiming the pleats toward the middle of the wrapper opening. Place assembled dumpling pleated side up on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover dumpling with a clean kitchen towel to prevent drying. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.   To prepare sauce: In a small bowl whisk the sauce ingredients to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. To cook dumplings: Pour water into a wok or large pot to a depth of 3 inches and heat over medium-high heat to a strong simmer.

Arrange dumplings in steamers at least  1/2 inch apart. Cover steamers and steam dumplings until filling is cooked through and wrappers are translucent 6 to 8 minutes. Remove dumplings from steamer.  To serve: Arrange the dumplings onto a large warm platter and serve immediately with dipping sauce on the side.  
Little Lemon Cakes Filled with Vanilla Pastry Cream,Southern Italian Desserts,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Little Lemon Cakes Filled with Vanilla Pastry Cream,16 cakes,  Cake: 4 large eggs separated at room temperature  1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar Finely grated zest from 1 small lemon Pinch of kosher salt  2/3 cup (88 g) cake flour  Glaze:  2 cups (250 g) confectioners' sugar 2 tablespoons corn syrup or glucose syrup 3 tablespoons hot water  3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  Chocolate or rainbow diavoletti (sprinkles) or candied cherries for decoration (optional)  1  3/4 cups (480 g) pastry cream (Recipe follows) cooled  Pastry Cream: 2 cups (480ml) half-and-half 1 medium lemon peel only 4 large egg yolks  3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar  3/4 cup (32g) cornstarch   ,  Biting into one of these cream-filled glazed pastries inevitably elicits a sigh the meaning of sospiri. They might remind you of a whoopie pie their two cake layers bonded by a creamy filling but I knew these well before I was introduced to the American dessert. In my hometown we referred to these as “i dulci”-our sweets. In fact I grew up believing that they were a specialty of our town; it wasn't until later that I discovered their name and that they were made and sold throughout Southern Italy.  My uncle Luigi learned to make the dessert from relatives in Serino near Avellino. He was the sole person in Verbicaro who knew how to make them and he guarded his secret recipe allowing nobody to enter his house when he baked. People in town would put in special orders with him when they needed sospiri for an event. He stopped his craft only when a pasticceria opened in town and people began to buy them there. Even now nobody would give up a recipe; I was on my own to re-create it. When my mom pronounced mine better than the ones sold in the pasticceria back home I knew they were ready to include here.  To produce the lightest cakes have your eggs at room temperature before you begin-leave them on the counter overnight or put them into a bowl of warm water for 10 to 15 minutes. Make the sospiri a day or two in advance; they improve as the cake soaks up the filling and glaze.   To make the cake: beat the egg yolks  3/4 cup of the sugar and the lemon zest at high speed in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment or with a handheld electric mixer until pale yellow and thick about 5 minutes.  In a clean bowl using clean beaters beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt beginning at medium-low speed until the whites are frothy then increasing to medium speed until they are very thick and frothy. Slowly add the remaining  3/4 cup of sugar a few teaspoons at a time then beat at medium-high speed until the whites form firm but not dry peaks that hold their shape when the beater is lifted.   Use a large spatula to gently fold the egg yolks into the whites until mostly combined but still a little streaky. Sift the cake flour over the batter in six additions gently folding in each addition until the flour is completely and evenly incorporated taking care not to deflate the batter.   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) with rack in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.  Scoop the batter into a piping bag fitted with 5/8-inch round tip (Ateco#808). Pipe out 2-inch rounds with one inch all around them forming sixteen rounds on each sheet. Bake just until the tops begin to lightly color about 12 minutes rotating the pans top to bottom and front to back halfway through baking.   Let the cakes cool completely on the baking sheets. When they are cool slide a small offset spatula under the cakes to loosen them turning them bottom side up and arranging them in matching pairs.   To make the glaze: whisk together the confectioners' sugar corn syrup hot water and vanilla in a heatproof bowl. Place the bowl over a small pan of simmering water so that the bowl is over but not touching the water. Stir the glaze just until it is smooth and warm about 1 minute. Remove the bowl from the pan and set it aside to cool slightly while you fill the sospiri.  To make the pastry cream: Bring the half-and-half and lemon peel to a simmer in a small saucepan; do not let it come to a full boil.  Meanwhile in a 2 to 3-quart heavy nonreactive saucepan whisk the egg yolks and sugar until they are completely smooth and slightly thickened. Whisk in the cornstarch until it is completely incorporated.  Use a fork to carefully remove and discard the lemon peel from the half-and-half. Add the half-and-half to t

Backyard Citrus Coconut Ice Pops,Recipe courtesy of Scraps,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Backyard Citrus Coconut Ice Pops,4 to 6 pops  Learn more about Scraps ,  1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk or (11.5-ounce) sweetened condensed coconut milk 1 whole orange thinly sliced   1/2 cup water  1/8 teaspoon kosher salt  1 cup unsweetened toasted coconut flakes for garnish    , Prep the pan: Line a 9" x 5" loaf pan with parchment paper making sure there is a generous 3-4" of overhang. Alternately you can use ice pop molds.   Blend the ice pops: Put all ingredients except toasted coconut into your KitchenAid&#174; Pro Line Series blender and blend gradually increasing speed until smooth about 40-60 seconds.   Freeze the pops: Pour into loaf pan (or molds) and freeze until solid about 8 hours.   Assemble the pops: Lift pops out of loaf pan and pull away parchment. Using a sharp knife cut between the sticks into 4-6 bars. Insert ice pop sticks into the short end of the bars. Let pops warm up at room temperature for a few minutes if this is difficult. If using ice pop molds follow manufacturer's instructions for unmolding.  Roll ice pops in coconut and eat immediately or store in the freezer.  Notes: What's left: Nothing!   Whole citrus (rind and all) and citrus zest (outer skin) is a scrap. Typically only used for its juice the outer zest and rind are delicious used in small quantities. Citrus is a common kitchen staple year-round. The white citrus rind has a concentrated scent and flavor without the acidity of the juice. The pith (white part) can be bitter but when used in small amounts can balance out sweet flavors. Feel free to swap in other citrus for the orange. Be aware that the flavor will change so start with a little and taste as you go. You'll be eating the rind so use organic thin-skinned citrus here if possible.  For dairy-free ice pops use sweetened condensed coconut milk. Nature's Charm brand makes an 11.5-ounce can that will yield slightly smaller bars. Find it in the health food aisle.  Flavor combos to try: 2 limes  1/2 orange + 1 lime and  1/2 grapefruit +  1/2 orange.  Garnish ideas: Drizzle pops with melted chocolate. Sprinkle pops with chopped nuts.Toast coconut flakes on a sheet tray in the oven at 350&#176F until golden (about 10 minutes) then sprinkle.  Freeze extra ice pops in an airtight container loosely wrapped in scrap pieces of parchment paper.

Almond-Chocolate Spritz Cookies with Orange Blossom Water,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Almond-Chocolate Spritz Cookies with Orange Blossom Water,45 cookies,  Dough:  1/2 cup (5 ounces) firmly packed almond paste (do not substitute marzipan)   3/4 cup (5 3/4 ounces) sugar 1 3/4sticks (7 ounces) unsalted butter softened (65 degrees  to 68 degrees F)  1 large egg plus 1 yolk 1 teaspoon orange blossom water or pure vanilla extract 2 cups (10 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour Pinch of salt  Chocolate Filling: 2 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate (up to 56 percent cacao) finely chopped 1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream   , Buttery spritz cookies the much-anticipated standard on the holiday cookie platter deserve to be enjoyed all year-round. Instead of saving these for special occasions why not make some to enjoy with a cup of tea as an after-school snack or with a bowl of ice cream? These are deeply almond due to the inclusion of almond paste with a lovely tender crumb and enough structure to support a pool of dark chocolate in the center. The orange blossom water with its delicate perfume of white citrus flowers lends another subtle layer of flavor. If you can't find orange blossom water substitute vanilla extract which will impart its own unique floral notes to the dough.  Mix the dough: Place the almond paste and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a food processor). Beat on medium speed for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes (or process for 45 seconds) until the almond paste is broken into tiny pieces. Add the butter and continue to beat for another 2 minutes (or process for 1 minute) until the mixture is well blended and slightly lighter in color. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with the spatula.  Add the egg and yolk and blend well (or process for 15 seconds). Add the orange blossom water and beat another 15 seconds to blend (or process for 5 seconds). Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the flour and salt. Turn the mixer to the lowest speed and blend slowly (or process for 10 to 15 seconds) just until there are no more patches of flour. Remove the bowl and stir gently a few times with the spatula to make sure there are no patches of unincorporated flour or butter near the bottom of the bowl.  Shape the dough: Line the baking sheets with parchment paper. Immediately spoon half of the dough into the pastry bag fitted with the star tip. Pipe rosettes on a prepared baking sheet spacing the cookies about 1 inch apart. (Alternatively use the cookie press according to the manufacturer's instructions.) The rosettes should be about  1/2 inch thick and about 1 3/4 inches in diameter. Repeat with the remaining dough. Chill the sheets in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position two oven racks in the upper and lower thirds.  Bake the cookies switching the sheets between the racks and rotating each front to back halfway through for 15 to 20 minutes until the cookies are rich golden brown around the edges and across the bottom. Transfer to a cooling rack. Immediately use the rounded handle end of the wooden spoon (or another kitchen utensil) to make a depression in the center of each cookie about  1/2 inch across. Be careful not to push so hard that you crack the cookie or break through to the baking sheet below. Let the cookies cool completely.  Fill the cookies: Place the chopped chocolate and cream in the microwave safe bowl and microwave on low for 30 seconds. Stir the mixture. Heat again for 30 seconds and stir until smooth. If there are still lumps heat again for 30 seconds. Once smooth spoon a little chocolate into each depression in the cookies. Allow the filling to cool and set completely.  Storing: These cookies are at their best the first or second day. Keep them in an airtight container layered between sheets of parchment or waxed paper to keep them from sticking to each other for up to 4 days.   
Mexican Chocolate Crackle Cookies,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Mexican Chocolate Crackle Cookies,45 cookies,  3 tablespoons unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces 1 tablespoon coffee liqueur or cooled brewed coffee 6 ounces 70 percent cacao bittersweet chocolate finely chopped 2 large eggs  1/2 cup granulated sugar plus additional  1/2 cup  3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 cup whole almonds toasted and cooled completely  3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  1/2 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 teaspoon ancho chili powder (optional)  3/4 cup unsifted confectioners' sugar   , This is a great place to use that extra-dark 70 percent cacao chocolate you've had your eye on. Because of how they are mixed the cookies are very chocolaty yet surprisingly light and delicate. The touch of chili powder adds an intriguing backnote and a sultry earthiness that enhances the chocolate flavor.   You can find ancho chili powder in the Mexican spice section at the supermarket or specialty Mexican and Latin American markets. The dough is made using the sponge method-that is the eggs and sugar are whipped together until very light in texture then the remaining ingredients are added.   Before baking each ball of dough is coated first in granulated sugar and then in a thick layer of confectioners' sugar. The granulated sugar creates a thin crisp outer shell during baking while the confectioners' sugar adds a cooling sweetness to each bite. As the cookies rise big chocolate cracks form in the white coating creating the dramatic two-tone look of the cookie.   Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in the bottom of the double boiler. Place the butter liqueur and chocolate in the top of the double boiler (off the heat). Turn off the heat then set the chocolate over the steaming water. Stir occasionally with the spatula until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove and let cool slightly while you whip the eggs.  Place the eggs and  1/2 cup of the granulated sugar in the bowl of the mixer and whip on high speed until very light in color and thick 5 to 6 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl though you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape the melted chocolate mixture into the eggs and whip until blended about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Place the flour nuts cinnamon baking powder and chile powder (if using) in the food processor and process until the nuts are very finely chopped 60 to 90 seconds. Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and beat on low speed just until combined. Stir gently a few times with the spatula to make sure there are no patches of unincorporated flour or butter lurking near the bottom of the bowl. Cover the dough with plastic and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours until firm.  Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Line the baking sheets with parchment paper.  Scoop the chilled dough into tablespoon-size balls using the ice cream scoop or a spoon. Place the remaining  1/2 cup of granulated sugar in one small bowl and the confectioners' sugar in the other. Roll each dough ball in the granulated sugar and then in the confectioners' sugar. Be sure to coat the dough generously with the confectioners' sugar&#45;in this instance more is better. Space the cookies about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.  Bake the cookies one sheet at a time rotating the sheet halfway through the baking time for 11 to 14 minutes until the cookies are puffed and cracked. If you nudge a cookie it should slide on the sheet rather than stick. It is better to slightly underbake these cookies than to go too far&#45;when overbaked they are dry and unpalatable. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.  Storing: These cookies are best the same day they are baked. Any leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 to 4 days.   
Lime Macarons,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Lime Macarons,35 sandwhich cookies,  7 ounces confectioners' sugar 4 ounces almond flour 4 large (4 ounces) egg whites at room temperature  1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 3 1/2 ounces granulated sugar Wilton bright green gel food coloring  Lime-Vanilla Buttercream (Click for recipe)  , Preheat oven to 300 degrees F with rack placed in the lower section of the oven. Fit baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Make sure the pans are flat (not dented or warped) and the parchment is trimmed to fit pan. Using paper templates trace circles onto the parchment or place them under the silicone mats.    In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade process confectioners' sugar and almond flour into a fine powder about 30 seconds. Using a drum sieve sift mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper three times and discard any coarse meal (no more than  1/2 teaspoon). Set aside.  To make the meringue: To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment add egg whites and cream of tartar; whip whites on medium speed until foamy. Gradually add sugar stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Once all the sugar is incorporated continue to whip meringue into stiff glossy peaks. The meringue should have the consistency of shaving cream. Whisk in about  3/4 teaspoon of food coloring adding more as needed until the desired color is achieved. The meringue should remain thick and stable.    To complete the macaronnage step: Add one-third of the sifted flour mixture to the meringue and fold with the spatula. Once incorporated add the remaining flour mixture smearing the batter along the sides of the bowl and then folding back to the center being careful not to over mix. Repeat until the batter becomes shiny and reaches the consistency of slow moving lava. To check for the correct consistency the batter should flow from your spatula like thick lava and hold a ribbon for a couple of seconds then fall back into itself making a smooth glossy surface. If it falls in clumps and doesn't flow slowly continue to fold gently deflating the batter until the proper consistency is reached.  Transfer batter to a pastry bag fitted with a  1/2-inch plain round tip. Pipe a small dollop of batter into the corners of each baking sheet and lay parchment over (ink side down) and press down corners to secure. Using both hands to hold the pastry bag pipe batter by placing the tip  1/2-inch above the parchment directly in the center of the first stenciled circle and fill. Once the circle is filled stop squeezing and make a quick upward and sideways motion to detach the batter and move to the next circle. (The batter should settle into a smooth and glossy round circle.)   Let macarons stand at room temperature until a firm skin forms on the macarons 30 to 45 minutes. To check to see if the macarons are ready lightly touch the side and if your finger does not make a dent they are ready for the oven.   Bake macarons one sheet at a time rotating halfway through until macarons are crisp and firm 14 to 16 minutes. Carefully slide macaron topped parchment sheets onto a wire rack and allow macarons to cool completely before removing from paper and filling.  To assemble: Pipe a cherry-size portion of buttercream into the center of the flat side of a cooled macaron. Place another cookie flat side down over the filling and gently press just enough to push the filling out towards the edges. Once filled macarons can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 3 days. 
Chocolate Cocoa Nib Shortbread Cookies,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Chocolate Cocoa Nib Shortbread Cookies,36 cookies,   3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar  3/4 cup (1 ounce) roasted cocoa nibs 1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces  3/4 cup (3 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour plus additional 2 tablespoons (4 3/4 ounces total) 3 tablespoons ( 3/4 ounce) unsweetened cocoa powder either Dutch-process or natural  1/8 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons sanding or decorator's sugar (optional)   , Cocoa Nibs are the cracked and roasted interior of cocoa beans-chocolate before it becomes chocolate. They are bitter (think coffee beans) and deeply flavored-and divine in this grown up cookie.  Place the granulated sugar and cocoa nibs in the bowl of the food processor and pulse four or five times to combine. Add the butter flour cocoa and salt and process for about 45 seconds. Scrape down the bowl and break up any large clumps with the spatula. Process for another 15 to 30 seconds until the dough looks uniformly dark and forms large shaggy clumps. Dump the dough out onto a work surface and knead gently several times just to bring it together.  Squeeze the dough into a log about 12 inches long and about 1 inch in diameter and gently roll it back and forth until smooth. Don't add flour if the dough is sticky-simply refrigerate the dough for 15 or 20 minutes to firm up the butter then try again.  If you like sprinkle the sanding sugar on the work surface alongside the log and gently roll the log in the sugar turning to coat evenly. Cut a piece of plastic wrap several inches longer than the log and center the log at one long edge of the wrap. Roll the log into the wrap so it is tightly bound by the plastic. Twist the ends of the wrap to secure the log and help to create a rounded shape. You can use a cardboard paper towel roll to keep the roll of dough nicely rounded during storage. Just slit the cardboard lengthwise and slip the log inside it to help keep the rounded shape. Refrigerate for 2 hours.  Preheat the oven to 300&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper.  Remove the cardboard and plastic wrap from the dough log and use a thin knife to slice it into &#8540;-inch-thick rounds.   Place about 18 cookies 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Bake rotating the sheet halfway through the baking time for 30 minutes or until the cookies are cooked through and look dry on top. (It's difficult to tell when dark chocolate cookies are done. This is when an oven thermometer and a timer are your best friends in the kitchen.) Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack and let them cool completely.  Storing: Keep the cooled cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.  Cutout Shortbread Cookies: Shape the prepared dough into a flat disk wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes to chill slightly. Lightly dust your work surface and the top of the dough with flour and roll the dough into a 10 3/4-inch circle about 3/8" thick. Alternatively roll the dough between two sheets of parchment or wax paper.   Chill the dough again for 30 minutes. Cut into shapes using the cookie cutter of your choice and transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets. To reroll scraps brush any flour from the top and bottom of the dough knead gently to bring together and roll again. If the dough is sticky chill it for 15 to 20 minutes and try again.   Once all the cookies are cut transfer the baking sheets to the refrigerator and chill the cutout cookies for 30 minutes then bake and store as directed.   Note: The size of your cookie cutter will affect the yield of the recipe as you may get only 1 to 2 dozen cookies.

The brilliant yellow and orange filling looks like sunshine spilling onto the plate. Think wide sandy beaches a hammock between two palm trees the soothing crash of the surf...  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center.

Remove any remaining “eyes&rdquo; with the tip of your knife. Use a pineapple slicer to core the pineapple and quarter it lengthwise. Alternatively use the chef's knife to slice the pineapple into quarters lengthwise and make an angled lengthwise cut along each quarter to remove the core. Cut each quarter lengthwise in half or thirds depending on the size of the pineapple then crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Transfer to the large bowl.  Rub off and discard the tiny hard stem piece on the end of each kumquat (some may not have this). Use a paring knife to cut each fruit in half crosswise then use the tip of your knife to pick out any seeds. Cut each half in two then add to the bowl with the pineapple.

Scrape into the baking dish and spread in an even layer. Sprinkle the topping in an even layer over the fruit.  Bake and serve the crisp: You may want to place a baking sheet or a piece of foil under the crisp to catch any juices that may bubble over.

Summer Berry Turnovers,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Summer Berry Turnovers,9 turnovers,  1 recipe Easy Cream Cheese Pie Dough prepared for turnovers and dumplings:  Click here for recipe »    1 half-pint basket (6 ounces) raspberries 1 half-pint basket (6 ounces) blackberries  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 large egg yolk 2 tablespoons milk or cream 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons sanding sugar turbinado sugar or granulated sugar Softly whipped cream vanilla creme fraiche honeyed yogurt or vanilla ice cream for serving   , Turnovers are great for breakfast snacking or dessert and can even be made with savory fillings for a take-along lunch or dinner. A slightly tart fruit filling will balance the richness of the cream cheese dough and dusting the tops with sugar before baking gives the turnovers a wonderful crunch and an extra layer of sweetness.  Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F and position two racks in the lower and upper thirds of the oven. Line the baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Make the filling: Pour the raspberries and blackberries out onto a baking sheet. Pick through them and discard any debris or molded berries. Do not wash them&#45; they will absorb the water and turn to mush. Transfer the berries to the medium bowl. Add the sugar flour and lemon juice and toss until the berries are evenly coated. Assemble the turnovers: Lay the 5-inch squares of cream cheese dough in front of you. On each square use a ruler or the back of a paring knife to mark a diagonal dividing line where you will fold the square in half to shape the turnover. (Be careful to mark the dough not cut through it.) Divide the berry filling evenly among the squares keeping it on one side of the dividing line and leaving a  1/2-inch border at the edges. In a small bowl lightly beat the egg yolk with the milk or cream to create an egg wash. For each turnover use a pastry brush to brush the border around the fruit with a thin film of the egg wash (set the rest of wash aside). Fold the dough in half over the fruit and press the edges with the tines of a fork to seal them. Transfer all the turnovers to one of the prepared baking sheets and refrigerate for 20 minutes before baking. Glaze and bake the turnovers: Divide the turnovers between the baking sheets 5 on one and 4 on the other. Brush the top of each turnover with a thin coating of egg wash and sprinkle with the sanding sugar. Use the tip of a paring knife to cut several slits in the top of each to allow steam to escape during baking. Bake the turnovers for 15 minutes then rotate the sheets from front to back and switch the sheets between the racks. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer until the pastry is golden brown. Transfer to a cooling rack. Serve the turnovers warm or at room temperature with whipped cream creme fraiche honeyed yogurt or vanilla ice cream. Storing: The turnovers keep at room temperature wrapped in plastic for 2 days. The plastic may soften the crust so to re-crisp and rewarm heat in a 375&deg;F oven for 10 minutes or until warmed through. For longer storage wrap airtight and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Reheat before serving.

In a medium bowl use a whisk to combine the yolks sugar and salt. Slowly pour the warm cream in a steady stream into the yolk mixture whisking until combined. Transfer mixture back to the saucepan and cook over  medium-low heat stirring constantly until the mixture coats the back of a spoon or registers 160 degrees F on an instant read thermometer about 5 minutes. Pour the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl and stir in the vanilla.  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler set over simmering water (or in a glass bowl in a microwave at 50 percent power for 3 to 5 minutes until melted) stirring frequently. Whisk custard into chocolate until smooth allow to cool.  In a stand mixer fitted with a whip attachment add the remaining 1  3/4 cup cream and whip until soft peaks form about 3 minutes. Using a silicone spatula fold in one-third of the cream into the chocolate custard until almost completely combined then fold in the remaining cream in two more stages. Stop folding when all of the cream is thoroughly incorporated the mousse is smooth and the color is even.    Spoon chocolate mousse into serving dishes or a storage container and chill covered until set about 2 hours. Let the mixture stand at room temperature about 15 minutes prior to serving.

Milk-and-Cookies Cake,Martha Stewart,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Milk-and-Cookies Cake,one 9-inch layer cake,  FOR THE CAKE 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted  butter room temperature  plus more for pans 3 cups cake flour  (not self-rising)  plus more for pans 1 tablespoon baking powder  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup packed  dark-brown sugar  2/3 cup granulated sugar 4 large eggs plus  2 large egg yolks 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups buttermilk 1 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips plus more for decorating  FOR THE WALNUT TOFFEE CRUNCH 6 tablespoons unsalted butter  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 cup walnut halves toasted  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  FOR THE CR&#200;ME ANGLAISE BUTTERCREAM 10 large egg whites 2 3/4 cups granulated sugar 8 sticks (4 cups) unsalted butter room temperature 1 tablespoon vanilla extract  3/4 cup nonfat dry milk powder   , This is what happens when your favorite childhood dessert grows up. We created this elegant cake with milk and cookies in mind: The batter is brown sugar–tinged for  a cookie-dough-like flavor and flecked with miniature chocolate chips— plus toffee for a caramel crunch. And the milk? A luscious creme anglaise buttercream.  Make the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Brush two 9-inch round cake pans with butter. Line with parchment; butter parchment. Dust with flour tapping out any excess. In a large bowl whisk together cake flour baking powder and salt. With an electric mixer beat butter and both sugars on high speed until light and fluffy about 6 minutes. Add whole eggs and egg yolks one at a time beating well after each addition until combined. Beat in vanilla extract. With mixer on low add flour mixture to butter mixture in three batches alternating with butter-milk beginning and ending with flour and scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Stir in mini chocolate chips.  Divide batter evenly between prepared pans smoothing tops with an offset spatula. Bake until cake tester comes out clean about 35 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack to cool 10 minutes. Turn out cakes onto rack to cool completely.  Make the walnut toffee crunch: In a medium saucepan heat butter and granulated sugar over high stirring until butter is melted. Continue to cook stirring occasionally until mixture is dark amber 8 to 10 minutes more. Add toasted walnuts and salt and stir to combine; transfer immediately to a baking sheet lined with a nonstick baking mat to set. Once cooled roughly chop.  Make the buttercream:  In bowl set over (not in) a saucepan of simmering water whisk together egg whites and granulated sugar. Cook whisking occasionally until mixture is completely smooth when rubbed between two fingers 3 to 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat. With an electric mixer whisk on low speed for 1 minute; then increase speed to medium-high and beat until stiff glossy peaks form 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce speed to medium-low and add butter a few pieces at a time until all is incorporated. Add vanilla and then nonfat milk powder and whisk to combine. Switch to the paddle attachment and beat on low speed about 2 minutes to remove any air bubbles.  For assembly:  With a serrated knife split each cake in half horizontally to form a total of 4 layers. Anchor bottom layer on a cake board with a dab of buttercream. Spread a generous 1 cup butter-cream evenly over cake layer then top with one-third of walnut toffee crunch. Top with second cake layer pressing down lightly to adhere. Repeat process finishing with final cake layer bottom-side up. Spread a thin even layer of buttercream over top and sides to create a crumb coat. Refrigerate about 30 minutes. Spread remaining frosting evenly over top and sides finishing top with a decorative swirl if desired. Using remaining mini chocolate chips create a Swiss dot pattern around sides of cake. Refrigerate until firm about 30 minutes. Bring to room temperature before serving.  DECORATING TIP To create a Swiss dot pattern around the sides of the cake apply a total of five rows of mini chocolate chips: Begin with a row in the center of the cake applying each chocolate chip approximately 1 1/2 inches apart. Repeat a row 1 1/2 inches above and below the initial one. Apply the final two rows in between the top and center rows and then between the center and bottom rows. Offset the placement of the first chip  by approximately  3/4 inch centering it between two chips in the above row   Reprinted from Martha Stewart’s Cake Perfection Copyright &#169; 2020 by Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia LP.

Classic Caesar Salad with Garlic Croutons,Knives Cooks Love:Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Sarah Jay photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/salads/greens-grains-legumes/Classic Caesar Salad with Garlic Croutons,4 servings (as an appetizer or side dish),  Croutons: 4 slices bacon (5 ounces) cut crosswise into thin strips 1 clove garlic 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 6 ( 1/2-inch) slices focaccia or ciabatta cut into  1/2-inch cubes (about 3 cups) Kosher salt  Dressing: 1 clove garlic  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 3 anchovy fillets 1 large egg yolk 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons loosely packed grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Freshly ground black pepper  10 large romaine lettuce leaves (preferably from the heart) washed and spun dry (about 12 cups) Shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for garnish   , The raw egg yolk emulsifies the dressing so it is creamy and rich but if you're concerned about serving uncooked eggs either use pasteurized whole eggs now available in some supermarkets or else omit the yolk entirely. Focaccia or ciabatta make pleasantly toothsome croutons; if they're not available English muffins are an excellent alternative. If you've never pureed garlic with the side of a chef's knife here's your chance.  To make the croutons set the bacon in a medium skillet over medium-low heat and cook stirring occasionally until crisp about 7 minutes.  Transfer the bacon to a plate; leave the fat in the pan and the burner on medium-low.  Smash and peel the garlic. Add the oil and garlic to the skillet and let sizzle until the garlic is light golden 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon out the garlic and discard it. Increase the heat to medium add the bread and season with a big pinch or two of salt.  Toast the bread tossing the pieces frequently until golden brown on a few sides about 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. (This yields more croutons than you'll need so it's okay to munch a few.)  To make the dressing mash the garlic and salt to a smooth puree using the side of a chef's knife. Scrape the puree into a small bowl.  Mash the anchovy fillet to a paste the same way and add it to the bowl. Add the egg yolk lemon juice and mustard to the bowl and whisk to blend. Gradually drizzle in the olive oil whisking constantly to maintain the emulsion. Add the grated cheese and a few grinds of pepper and stir to combine.  Cut or tear the lettuce across the ribs into large bite-size pieces. Put them in a large wooden salad bowl. Drizzle about three quarters of the dressing on top and toss. The leaves should be just lightly coated; if needed drizzle on the rest of the dressing. Add the croutons and bacon and toss. Sprinkle the cheese shavings on the salad plus a few grinds of black pepper and serve.

Gingerbread Cookies,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Gingerbread Cookies,48 large cookies,  5 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1- 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 cup (8-ounces) unsalted butter room temperature 1 cup dark brown sugar packed 2 medium eggs 1 cup molasses 2 teaspoons cinnamon  4 teaspoons ground ginger 2 teaspoons all-spice  1/2 teaspoon salt   , In a small bowl sift together flour baking soda and baking powder and set aside.   In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time and blend thoroughly after each addition scraping down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed.  Decrease speed to low and add molasses spices and salt. Mix until well combined about 1 minute. With mixer on low speed add flour mixture until thoroughly combined.  Divide the dough in equal thirds wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.   Preheat an oven to 350 degrees and position an oven rack in the center.   Once the dough has chilled prepare a clean work surface with flour and roll out the dough to your desired thickness. For crisp cookies roll out thin and for denser cookies roll out thicker.  Use flour on the bottom and top of the dough to prevent the dough from sticking. Alternatively you can roll the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap or parchment paper.   Cut out shapes using the cookie cutter and transfer cookies to ungreased cookie sheets. Transfer the cookies to the preheated oven and bake until they are slightly brown around the edges about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and leave to completely cool. Repeat with the remaining dough.  Decorate cookies with Royal Icing (recipe to follow) and food safe markers.   Royal Icing  Yields 3 cups   This light and fluffy icing is traditionally used for glazing cookies preparing walls of a gingerbread house and piping decorations. Should you prefer a thinner consistency glaze add a little more water to the mixture to thin-out.   To color the frosting it is recommended that you use gel paste or powdered colors. Liquid food coloring can dilute the frosting making the end result separated and grainy. Professional bakers suggest placing an uncut pastry bag inside of the filled pastry bag when not in use to prevent the pastry bag from hardening at the tip.     3/4 cup meringue powder  3/4 teaspoon salt 3- 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar sifted  3/4 cup cold water Food colorings of your choice (optional)   In the bowl of a stand-mixer fitted with a paddle attachment combine the meringue powder salt and confectioners' sugar.  With the mixer on low slowly add the water and beat until the sugar is dissolved about 1 minute. Increase the mixer speed to medium then to high over several minutes until the icing is pale and fluffy about 4 minutes.   Transfer the frosting to a clean container and cover with a damp towel. If using food colors divide frosting into smaller containers and mix until well combined.   To use for piping put a tip onto the bottom of a disposable pastry bag. Using a coupler will allow you to change tips easily.

Cheddar Crust Apple Pie,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Cheddar Crust Apple Pie,8 servings,  2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 10 tablespoons (1 3/4 sticks) cold unsalted butter cut into tablespoons 6 ounces firmly packed coarsely grated extra-sharp cheddar cheese cold  3/4 cup ice water or more as needed  4 pounds Golden Delicious apples 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter divided  1/2 cup sugar divided plus 1 teaspoon  3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon heavy cream or whole milk   ,  The attractive high dome of an apple pie can be considered a ruse as the apples have shrunk leaving a big space between the filling and the crust. Precooking the apples will minimize the gap and concentrate the apple flavor too.   To make the dough put the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse briefly to combine them. Scatter the butter and cheddar cheese over the top and pulse about 12 times. Sprinkle ice water 2 tablespoons at a time over the flour mixture. Pulse until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps do not hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and pulsing. Turn the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and gather it together. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled but not hard 1 to 2 hours.  To make the filling peel and quarter the apples and cut out the core from each quarter. Cut each quarter lengthwise into thirds and place in a large bowl. As you add the slices to the bowl occasionally sprinkle and toss the apples with lemon juice. (Don't wait until the apples are cut or the first slices will already have turned brown.)  In a large skillet melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add half the apples and  3/4 cup of the sugar. Cook stirring often for about 7 minutes or until the apples are barely tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Transfer to a large mixing bowl or rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter the second half of the apples and another  3/4 cup sugar. If your skillet is smaller than 12 inches cook the apples in three batches. Let the filling cool completely stirring occasionally. Sprinkle the flour and cinnamon over the cooled filling and toss well.  Position a rack in the center of the oven and place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Lightly flour a work surface and place 1 dough disk in the center dusting a little flour on top. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round about  1/8 inches thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over a 9 inch pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to hang over the sides. Fill with the apples. Trim the overhanging dough to  1/2 inch. Roll out the remaining pie dough into a second 12 inch round. Transfer the dough round the same way centering it over the apple filling. Fold the overhang of the upper round under the edge of the bottom crust. Pinch the crusts together and flute the edge attractively. Cut a small hole in the center of the pie to allow steam to escape. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Lightly brush the top crust with the cream. Sprinkle the top crust with the remaining teaspoon of sugar.  Place the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake for 40 to 50 minutes until the top is golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Chipotle Chile Candied Pecans,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/desserts/confections/Chipotle Chile Candied Pecans,1 pound,   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 1 teaspoon ground chipotle chile powder 1 cup packed light brown sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large egg whites at room temperature  3/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt 1 pound large or jumbo pecan halves   , These candied pecans are flat-out decadent and irresistible. Sweet spicy with a hint of salt these meringue-sugar-crusted pecans are divine eaten out of hand with a tumbler of bourbon or Scotch. However a handful of these nuts tossed into a mesclun salad along with sweetened dried cranberries and crumbled blue cheese is the perfect starter to a holiday meal. This recipe can easily be doubled; use two baking sheets with a stick of butter melted on each and whip the double batch of meringue in a stand mixer or large mixing bowl.  Position a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Have ready a large rimmed baking sheet preferably nonstick for easier cleanup.  Melt the butter on the baking sheet in the oven. Be careful not to let the butter brown. Set aside.  Combine the chile powder and brown sugar in a small bowl. Pour the vanilla over the brown sugar. Set aside.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment beat the egg whites on medium speed until foamy. Add  3/4 teaspoon of salt and beat on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Add the sugar mixture 2 tablespoons at a time beating on high speed to form a strong shiny meringue. Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to gently fold in the nuts until they are well coated.  Gently tip the rimmed baking sheet so the butter coats the bottom of the pan. Using a rubber spatula spread the nuts over the butter without stirring to form an even layer without deflating the meringue.  Bake the nuts for 20 minutes. Remove them from the oven and stir the nuts with a spatula moving the nuts at the center of the pan to the edges and the nuts at the edges closer to the center. Return the pan to the oven bake the nuts for 15 minutes longer and stir them again. Sprinkle the nuts with the remaining  1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Continue baking stirring every 15 minutes until the nuts are separated have absorbed the butter and glisten and are beautifully browned 45 minutes to 1 hour longer.  Immediately turn the nuts out onto a counter lined with a long sheet of aluminum foil spread them out and let cool completely.

It delivers dark chocolate in an elegant party dress and is also the only souffle that can be prepared up to 24 hours in advance and held in the refrigerator before baking. Since the sauce can be made in advance as well the combination is perfect for entertaining.  Preheat the oven to 375°F and position an oven rack in the bottom third. Generously butter the souffle dishes (including the rims) dust them with sugar and tap out the excess.  Melt the chocolate: Pour 2 inches of water in the bottom of the double boiler and bring to a rolling boil. Off the heat place the chocolate in the top of the double boiler. Turn the heat off and set the chocolate over the steaming water. Stir occasionally with the spatula until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Leave over the warm water until needed.

With the mixer running rain in the granulated sugar and beat until firm peaks form. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl. With a spatula gently stir one-fourth of the egg whites into the chocolate bechamel sauce to lighten the mixture. Fold in the remaining whites just until there are no more streaks of whites.  Fill the dishes and bake: Transfer the souffle batter to the pastry bag. Pipe the batter into each souffle dish filling it to  3/4 inch below the rim. Transfer the dishes to the baking sheet. Bake for 14 to 18 minutes (higher percentage chocolates will bake more quickly) until the souffles are set and firm to the touch in the center. Serve immediately dusted with confectioners' sugar and accompanied by individual pitchers of custard sauce.  For an over-the-top dessert break open the tops of the souffles and instead of the custard sauce pour in caramel sauce and chocolate sauce then top with generous spoonfuls of whipped cream. Pass additional sauce and cream around the table. Ooh-la-la!

Vanilla Creme Brulee,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Vanilla Creme Brulee,8 servings,  3 cups (24 ounces) heavy whipping cream  1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) plus 5 tablespoons (2 3/4 ounces) pure cane sugar 1 vanilla bean 9 large egg yolks   , This is it the ultimate in sweet creamy richness topped with a crisp crust of caramelized sugar. You'll surprise everyone by serving one of the most popular restaurant desserts ever and no one needs to know how simple it is. The vanilla bean gives every bite a round deep vanilla flavor as well as an unmistakable underpinning of spicy floral notes. You can substitute other flavorings&#45;orange or lemon zest coffee beans spices or a combination of these&#45;to create a personalized crème brûlée. For a less rich yet still delicious version substitute whole milk for half of the cream. If you don't have a propane or butane torch for caramelizing the tops for an alternative method.  Make and flavor the custard: Place the cream and  1/2 cup of the sugar in the medium saucepan. Use the tip of a paring knife to split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Turn the knife over and use the dull side to scrape out the seeds and add both the seeds and the pod to the saucepan. Whisk well to break up the clumps of vanilla seeds. Cook over medium-low heat stirring several times to dissolve the sugar just until the mixture begins to simmer. Remove the pan from the heat cover and let steep for 30 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center.  Temper the eggs: Reheat the mixture over medium heat uncovered until it begins to simmer. In the medium bowl whisk the egg yolks. Twist a damp kitchen towel into a rope and wrap it around the bottom of the bowl to secure it while you temper the eggs. Pour about  1/2cup of the hot milk mixture into the eggs whisking constantly. Once blended whisk in another  1/2 cup. Then slowly pour the rest of the mixture into the eggs whisking constantly.  Strain and bake the custard: Pour the mixture through the strainer into the pitcher. Reserve the vanilla pod (rinse it under water and let it dry then save it for use in vanilla sugar). Place the custard cups in the large roasting pan making sure they don't touch and divide the warm custard among them. Pull out the oven rack and place the pan on the rack. Remove one of the cups pour enough hot tap water (not boiling) into that area to come halfway up the sides of the cups and replace the cup. Cut a piece of foil large enough to fit just inside the edges of the roasting pan then lay the foil across the top of the cups making sure it doesn't touch the custard. You may need to smooth and flatten the foil on the counter if any wrinkles touch the custard. Gently push the rack back into the oven shut the oven door and bake the custards for 35 to 50 minutes until edges of the custards are almost set—there should still be a small liquid area in the very center of the custard about the size of a dime (test by gently tapping the side of the pan).  Remove the foil and then the pan from the oven being careful not to tilt the pan and splash water on top of the custards. Set the pan on a heatproof surface. Use the tongs (or your hand protected by a kitchen towel) to immediately remove the cups from the water bath and place them on a rack to cool to room temperature about 40 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold at least 4 hours or overnight.  Caramelize the custards: Sprinkle the surface of each cold custard with 2 teaspoons of the remaining sugar (use a tablespoon for large shallow crème brûlée dishes). Shake the cup gently to distribute the sugar evenly&#45;make sure it covers the custard all the way to the edge (any exposed custard will blacken immediately under the torch's flame). Set the sugared custards on a flameproof surface such as a metal baking sheet. Caramelize one custard at a time: Light the torch and with the tip of the flame just touching the surface move the flame over the sugar in a gentle circular motion until most of the sugar is melted and looks like tiny water droplets. Continue to heat using the sa

Asian Style Boneless Beef Short Ribs,Recipe developed for Fagor by America's TEST KITCHEN,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Asian Style Boneless Beef Short Ribs,6 servings,  6 (8-ounce) boneless beef short ribs trimmed 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 4 garlic cloves minced  1 (2-inch) piece ginger peeled and sliced into  3/4-inch-thick rounds and smashed  1/2 cup hoisin sauce 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons dry sherry 4 scallions white parts chopped coarse green parts sliced thin   3/4  teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro    ,  One of the keys to pressure-cooker success is using enough moisture to cook the food through and keep the pan from scorching but also to provide good flavor that isn't too diluted. We decided an Asian-style sauce made with hoisin soy sauce and sherry would do a good job accomplishing both goals for boneless beef short ribs.   After 35 minutes under pressure the meat was cooked through and had released its juices to create an intensely flavored sauce. It was more sauce than we would have gotten using a conventional stovetop or oven method since there was no evaporation from the pot but we didn't mind having extra sauce on hand- mixed with scallion greens and cilantro it made an excellent match for a big bowl of steamed white rice.    Total Time: About 1 hour 35 minutes under pressure Pressure Level: High Release: Natural   Build flavor: Cook oil garlic and ginger in pressure-cooker pot over medium-high heat until fragrant about 1 minute. Stir in hoisin sauce soy sauce sherry scallion whites and cayenne; add beef.   High pressure for 35 minutes:  Lock pressure-cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat. As soon as pot reaches high pressure reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 35 minutes adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure.  Naturally release pressure:  Remove pot from heat and allow pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes. Quick release any remaining pressure then carefully remove lid allowing steam to escape away from you.  Before serving:  Transfer short ribs to platter tent loosely with aluminum foil and let rest while finishing sauce. Strain sauce into fat separator let sit for 5 minutes then pour defatted sauce into small bowl. Stir scallion greens and cilantro leaves into sauce and serve with ribs over rice.  Alternate recipe:   Asian Style Short Ribs with Shiitakes:  Add 1 pound shiitake mushrooms stemmed and sliced to pressure-cooker pot with beef in step 1. After straining sauce through fat separator in step 4 discard ginger pieces then return strained mushrooms and defatted sauce to pressure-cooker pot and simmer gently as needed to thicken. Stir in 1 tablespoon Asian chile-garlic sauce with scallion greens and cilantro.  Troubleshooting:   What if my short ribs don't seem tender after removing the lid? If your short ribs don't look quite done after the 35-minute pressurized cooking time gently simmer them in the sauce until done. If the sauce thickens too much add water as needed.  Do I need to alter the recipe for a 6-quart electric pressure cooker? Yes turn the cooker off immediately after the pressurized cooking time and let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes; do not let the cooker switch to warm setting.  Tip: We've found using a spoon to be an easy way to peel a knobby piece of ginger because you easily maneuver around bumps. Adding a smashed piece of ginger at the beginning of cooking allows it to release its flavor and the ginger is then easy to remove before serving.

It's all about the cooking method which isn't grilling at all but rather &lsquo;griddling' or cooking on a flat hot surface. We recommend using a high-quality butter since it is a predominate ingredient in this recipe.  1. To prepare the caramelized onions: To a large skillet over medium heat add oil. When the oil is shimmering add the onions and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cook until the onions are soft and translucent 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the onions stirring frequently to prevent burning until golden about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.  2. To Scramble Eggs: To a medium size bowl add eggs and salt whisk well until frothy. Set eggs aside for 5 minutes. To a nonstick skillet set over medium-low heat add butter. When butter is melted add whisked eggs. Cook eggs stirring slowly and constantly until eggs begin to set and form large curds about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl or plate and wipe the plan clean.  3. To prepare sandwiches: Spread one side of each slice of bread generously with butter taking care not to tear the bread. Flip slices so the buttered side is down Divide the cheese between all of the slices then distribute the caramelized onion over half of the slices top the onion layer with the scrambled eggs then cover with the second slice of bread and cheese press gently to close.   4. To cook sandwiches: Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat working in batches place the sandwiches in the pan. Cook uncovered until the until the underside is a rich golden brown about 4 minutes. Carefully flip the sandwich and press it firmly with a spatula (but don't squash it). Cook until the second side is evenly browned as well and you can see the cheese melting inside and the crust is golden about 4 more minutes.   5. To serve: Transfer sandwiches to a cutting board slice in half and serve immediately.

Creamy rich cheese sauce makes this dish truly decadent.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). To make the gnocchi dough: wash and dry sweet potatoes. Cut a small slit in skins. Place in the oven and bake for 45 minutes or until fork-tender. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.  Cut cooled potatoes in half. Scoop flesh in to a medium bowl and mash with a potato masher. Stir in sage and Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Stir in sweet rice flour millet flour and almond flour mixing together well to form a soft sticky dough. To form gnocchi place dough onto a work surface lightly dusted with rice flour. Cut dough into 4 sections and work with one section at a time keeping the rest covered with plastic wrap. With your hands roll a section of dough into a long thin cylinder about 1in (2.5cm) wide. Cut cylinder into discs about  3/4 in (2cm) thick. Roll each disc into a small ball in your hands then place on the work surface and tap to slightly flatten. Place on a cutting board. When all are shaped run the tines of a fork over the tops of gnocchi to make indentations. Set aside in a cool place covered with plastic wrap until needed.  To make the gremolata: in a non-stick frying pan dry-fry hazelnuts over medium heat for 2  minutes stirring frequently until golden brown in places. Remove from heat. Once cool rub them well in a clean dish towel to remove as much of skins as possible. Set aside to cool then finely chop.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a small bowl mix together hazelnuts parsley lemon zest and Parmesan. Season well with black pepper.  Reduce boiling water to a simmer. Working in batches add gnocchi to water and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until they float to the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a plate lined with paper towel to absorb water. Continue until all are cooked.  Pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). To make the cheese sauce: add heavy cream and grated cheese to a small saucepan. Scatter sweet rice flour over the surface and whisk in. Slowly bring to a boil stirring constantly until sauce thickens and starts to bubble. Reduce heat to low and cook for 1 minute more until thick and smooth. Season with black pepper.  Grease a large shallow ovenproof dish. Arrange gnocchi in an even layer in the dish. Spread cheese sauce over top. Transfer to the top rack of the oven and bake uncovered for 10 to 12 minutes until the top is golden brown and crispy. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Scatter the top with hazelnut gremolata before serving.  Reprinted from Pasta Reinvented copyright &#169; 2018 by Caroline Bretherton.

Do not use beef stock 2 tablespoons tomato paste (or use imported Italian tomato paste in tubes which have a long shelf life and are of excellent quality) 8-10 small onions 5 carrots in 1-2 inch pieces 1 pound red potatoes or larger white potatoes in chunks 1 pound large mushrooms quartered   , Follow the basics of this recipe adding your favorite herbs or vegetables. Chopped onion celery and carrot are used at the beginning for flavor; add your choice of vegetables to be served with the meat for the final 40-60 minutes of cooking.  Over high heat pour sufficient oil to cover the bottom of a large Dutch oven or other large heavy pot (we use a large French enameled iron pot) generously salt and pepper both sides of the roast and sear meat until well browned on both sides. Remove meat and pour off oil. Return pot to medium heat and add chopped carrot celery onion and the garlic. Stir and cook vegetables adding a small amount of oil if necessary until softened but not browned. Sprinkle flour over vegetables and stir for 2-3 minutes. Return meat to pot adding water and stock tomato paste and herbs.   Bring to a simmer on top of the stove cover (use aluminum foil under cover if it does not fit tightly). Place into preheated 325 degree oven and cook for 2 hours. Check at 1 hour and turn meat if it is not covered by liquid; add additional water if liquid is too thick – it should be the consistency of thin gravy.  At 2-2  3/4 hours add remaining vegetables; the time varies according to size. Cook for a total of 3 hours. If the vegetables are not quite cooked cover and let sit-cooking will continue using retained heat. Check for seasoning adding salt or pepper to taste.  Skim excess fat from the liquid cut meat into serving size pieces arrange on a heated platter and surround with vegetables. Moisten with some of the liquid pass the remainder at the table and enjoy a true New England tradition.  
Pan-Seared Scallops with Deconstructed Guacamole,DeLille Cellars,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Pan-Seared Scallops with Deconstructed Guacamole,1 serving,  8 tomatillos roasted or grilled   1/2 bunch cilantro  16 large fresh scallops patted dry  Mild chili powder 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 avocado finely chopped 1 tomato seeded and finely chopped  1 onion minced  1/2 bunch fresh cilantro chopped 1 Anaheim pepper chopped 4 ounces sundried tomatoes finely chopped Hot sauce (optional)  Salt and pepper   , I love this dish because it is colorful easy and very versatile.  Anyone who has made guacamole before has already made deconstructed guacamole; you just sprinkle instead of blend.  The dish is versatile in three ways.  First if you like your guacamole in a different style you can adapt this recipe to your liking.  I have always liked sundried tomatoes but you may like serrano peppers instead.  Second you don't have to do this recipe on scallops.  You can use it on anything that goes well with guacamole; try hamburgers for example.  Third if you do use scallops you can create an amuse bouche (1 scallop) appetizer (2 scallops) or entree (4 scallops or more). This dish is best paired with a glass of 2014 DeLille Cellars Chaleur Estate Blanc .   To make the Tomatillos Puree: roast the tomatillos until marked soft and juicy; then cool.  Put tomatillos and the cilantro into a blender.  Puree and add salt to taste.  Set aside.   To make the Deconstructed Guacamole: finely chop avocado tomato onion cilantro Anaheim pepper and sundried tomatoes keep separate and ready to sprinkle on the scallops.  To make the Pan Seared Scallops: keep plates warm in a low temp oven. This is important so that the scallops stay warm when the dish is assembled.  Make sure the scallops are dry so they will sear properly.  Season with salt pepper and chili powder on one side.  Pan sear the scallops in the butter and oil mixture on high heat no more than 1 minute per side.  Plate chili powder side up.  To serve: I like to dot the plate around the scallops with the tomatillos puree.  Then starting with the avocado sprinkle all the chopped ingredients on top of the scallops.  Add salt pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce to taste. Note: guacamole not pictured.   
Caramel Corn,Zippy Pop Inc.,home/recipes/appetizers/dips-spreads-sauces-seasonings/Caramel Corn,1 serving,  3 to 4 tablespoons canola or coconut oil  3 1/3 cups popcorn  1 tablespoon butter   Caramel:   1/2 cup butter   1 cup brown sugar    3/4 cup corn syrup    1/2 teaspoon salt   3/4 teaspoon baking soda  1 teaspoon vanilla extract    , To make the caramel: Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Sweet Potato Fritters with Bacon-Shallot Jam,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/appetizers/hot/Sweet Potato Fritters with Bacon-Shallot Jam,8 fritters,  Bacon jam: 8 ounces smoked bacon slices; cut crosswise into  3/4-inch wide pieces 2 cups shallots peeled and thinly sliced crosswise 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  Fritters: 1 cup sweet potato puree  1/2 cup whole milk ricotta cheese 1 teaspoon granulated sugar  3/4 cup finely chopped chives 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 whole egg beaten  1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons canola oil for frying   , Think of bacon jam as a misnomer as it is really more of a relish-it is not as sweet and set as regular fruit jam. The flavor combination of sweet sour and salty is very addictive and is a lovely complement to the sweet potato fritters. Both can be made ahead and the fritters warmed through in the oven just before serving.  To prepare bacon jam: Place bacon pieces in a large skillet and place on the stove over medium heat. Cook bacon stirring occasionally until browned and crispy about 9 minutes. Using a slotted spoon transfer cooked bacon to a paper towel lined plate and set aside.  Return the skillet to medium-low heat; add the shallots and cook stirring occasionally until tender about 10 minutes. Add the sugar and balsamic vinegar and continue to cook until the liquid is absorbed about 5 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat and stir in the bacon. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to a small mixing bowl and set aside.   To prepare fritter batter: While the jam is cooking prepare the fritter batter. In a bowl use a whisk to thoroughly combine the sweet potato purée ricotta sugar chives and cinnamon until smooth. Stir in the egg until combined. Add the flour baking powder and salt. Using a silicone spatula fold the flour mixture into the potato mixture. Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper if needed  To cook fritters: Add the oil to a large skillet and when shimmering carefully place heaping tablespoons of the mixture into the skillet work in batches to avoid overcrowding of the skillet. Cook until fritters are golden-brown on both sides about 3 minutes per side. Using a spatula remove from the skillet and place onto a paper towel lined plate.   To serve: Arrange the cooked fritters onto a large serving platter and place a teaspoon of bacon-shallot jam on top of each one. Serve immediately.

Choose to garnish with a dollop of sour cream.    Place a large saucepan on the stove over a moderate heat and add oil. When the oil is shimmering add the onion and cook until tender about 7 minutes. Add the ginger and cook until fragrant about 1 minute. Add nutmeg and cook until deep brown in color about 1 minute. Add the sweet potato and cook until just starting to soften about 7 minutes.

Guatemalan Tamales,Julia Adelaida Escobar,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Guatemalan Tamales,about 50 tamales,  4 lbs banana leaves cut into 11" x 13"   Tamale Dough 2 lbs. maseca (corn dough) 2 lbs. rice soaked in cold water 30 minutes 16 cups of water 1 1/2 cup lard 2/3 cup salt 4 tablespoons of chicken bouillon 1 big onion scored  Salt and chicken bouillon to taste if more is needed  Filling: 1 lb. raisins  1 jar of green olives  4 red bell peppers julienned 2 lbs. of plum fruit (dried)  1/2 recipe Recado (recipe follows)  Recado (Chile Sauce)  1/2 pound tomatillos 3 pounds tomatoes 6 chiles de pasilla deseeded 3 chiles de guajillo deseeded 1 bag of pumpkin seeds 1 bag of sesame seeds 7 1/2 cups of water 3 tablespoons of salt  2 tablespoons of bouillon 2 rolls (bread bolillo for thickening) torn into 1-inch pieces 3 tablespoons lard 3 pounds pork loin cut into 3-inch pieces do not remove bones Salt to taste   , To cook the banana leaves: Bring a large stock pot of water to boil then add the banana leaves. After 3-5 minutes remove from heat. Cool leaves completely and dry thoroughly with a kitchen towel or paper towel.  In a blender add soaked rice and enough water to just cover the rice. Blend until milky.   To prepare the masa: In a large bowl add water to the dough and whisk together until the mixture is very loose. An alternative to whisking would be to use your hands to help dissolve the masa more efficiently.  (*This is an Escobar family trick!)  In a large stock pot add the lard and fry the onion on medium heat until translucent. While constantly stirring add the dough salt and chicken bouillon. Add the blended rice in batches and mix well to combine. Continue to stir until the masa begins to bubble and has thickened approximately 20-30 minutes.  To assemble the tamales: Lay a piece of foil under a banana leaf. Fill the center of each banana leaf with enough masa to create a round even layer  3/4"-thick and 3-inches wide.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of recado with a piece of pork into the center of the masa. Top masa with 1 of each topping. Continue to shape until all banana leaves have been used.  To wrap: Lay the tamales on a flat surface and fold the sides of the banana leaf over the filling to make a snug rectangular package. Enclose the tamale with the foil wrap tightly.   Once all tamales are wrapped pile them up into a large stock pot or tamalera if available. Add 12 cups of water. Cover and steam 2 hours. Remove from the stock pot and allow to cool 30 minutes.  Making the recado sauce:Preheat oven to broil with the oven rack placed in the middle.  Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the tomatoes and tomatillos on the prepared sheet and broil until the skin is charred. Remove from oven set aside and allow to cool.  In a skillet toast the pumpkin seeds sesame seeds and chiles over a medium heat until fragrant and golden brown.  Pulse the chile mixture cooled tomatoes and tomatillos in a blender until smooth.  Add torn bolillo a piece at a time until the sauce had thickened.  To par-cook the pork: In a medium stock pot add lard recado and pork loin and cook on medium heat until it boils.   Note: With this amount of yield you’ll have extra recado. What Julia Escobar recommends is to stew some of your favorite meats (her favorite is chicken) in the recado for 2-3 hours.

Double Corn Bread with Smoked Mozzarella and Sun-Dried Tomatoes,Things Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Marie Simmons photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Double Corn Bread with Smoked Mozzarella and Sun-Dried Tomatoes,8 servings,  1 3/4 cups yellow cornmeal  3/4 cup all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon coarse salt  1/8 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 2 large eggs 1 cup buttermilk  3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flavorless vegetable oil 1 cup fresh corn kernels (from 2 ears)  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons coarsely shredded smoked mozzarella or Gouda cheese  3/4 cup minced smoked ham (optional) 2 tablespoons finely chopped olive oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes rinsed and drained 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh Italian parsley   , There are many tempting flavor possibilities when it comes to corn bread. For this version smoked mozzarella or Gouda is substituted for the more traditional Cheddar or Monterey Jack. The addition of buttermilk gives the bread a tender crumb and a slight tang the dried tomatoes add a salty edge and the corn kernels reinforce the taste of the yellow cornmeal. Fresh corn is preferred although canned or thawed frozen kernels can be used.  Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F. Place a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over low heat on the stove top and leave it to heat while preparing the batter for the corn bread.  In a large bowl combine the cornmeal flour baking powder sugar salt and black pepper and stir with a standard whisk to mix. In a second large bowl whisk together the eggs buttermilk and  3/4 cup of the oil until blended. Stir into this second bowl the corn  1/2 cup of the cheese the ham the tomatoes and the parsley.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Add the buttermilk mixture and fold together with a rubber spatula just until blended.  Drizzle the heated skillet with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil tilting the pan to coat evenly. Immediately add the batter (the oil will sizzle and bubble up around the edges to coat the sides of the skillet) and spread it to the edges of the skillet using a rubber spatula. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons cheese.  Bake for 25 minutes or until the top is golden and the edges have pulled away from the sides of the skillet. Serve hot or at room temperature cut into wedges.

Set aside. Coat the inside of a bread pan with unsalted butter. Set aside.  In four small batches brown the butter. To brown butter use a large skillet and heat the butter over medium heat. Cook until the butter is golden brown. Pour the browned butter into a small bowl and continue this process until the 1  1/2 sticks of butter are browned. Let the butter cool slightly.  With a mixer cream the pureed pumpkin and sugar for 4 minutes.  With the mixer still running add the butter vanilla and eggs to the pumpkin mixture. In small batches add the dry ingredients. Continue to mix until all ingredients are well incorporated.  Turn off the mixture and add the apples. Stir well.  Pour the batter into the buttered bread pan. Place in the oven and cook for 75-85 minutes (or until the bread is cooked all the way through). If the top of the bread begins to look too brown place a piece of foil on top of it. I usually do this about 50 minutes into the baking process.  Serve warm with butter.

French Baguette,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/French Baguette,3 baguettes,  Poolish: 1 1/2 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour  3/4 cup cool water (approximately 60 degrees)  A pinch of yeast  Dough: 2 1/2 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon instant yeast 2 teaspoons kosher salt All of the polish  3/4 cup cool water (approximately 60 degrees)    ,  If desired you may create more steam in the oven by spraying the water into it twice during the first 5 minutes of baking. This extra moisture will help to create a crackly-crisp crust.   Poolish: Combine the flour water and yeast; mix until well-blended. Let the poolish rise covered at cool room temperature for 12 to 24 hours. It should dome slightly on the top and look aerated and bubbly. Try to catch it before it starts to fall as it will be at its optimum flavor and vigor when its at its highest point.  To prepare mixer method: Place the flour yeast and salt in the bowl of your mixer. Pour some of the water around the edges of the poolish in its container to loosen it. Pour the poolish and water onto the flour.   Using the flat beater paddle mix the dough on low speed for 3 minutes adding more flour or water if necessary to bring the dough together.  The dough should look a little sticky but should clean the sides of the bowl.  Switch to the dough hook and knead for 4 minutes cleaning the dough from the hook at the 2 minute mark.  To prepare bread machine method: Place the flour yeast and salt in the bucket or your bread machine. Pour some of the water around the edges of the poolish to loosen it from it's container.  Pour the poolish and water onto the flour. Program the machine for dough and press Start. Check the dough after about 10 minutes of kneading add more flour or water if needed to create a sticky dough.  To mix by hand: In a large bowl combine the dough ingredients with the poolish. Stir until the dough begins to come together. Oil your hands and use a dough scraper to knead the dough right in the bowl-this will help knead the dough without adding too much flour.   To prepare baguettes: Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl (or oil your mixer bowl and leave it in there). Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for 2 hours folding it over after the first hour (or more frequently if the dough is very slack or wet; this folding helps strengthen the gluten).   Divide the dough into three pieces and gently pre-form it into rough logs. Let it rest for 20 minutes and then shape it into baguettes. Proof the baguettes covered on your baguette pan until they're puffy looking 30 to 40 minutes.  Preheat your oven (and your baking stone if you have one) to 500 degrees. Just before putting the loaves into the oven slash the tops several times. Hold the knife at a 45 degree angle to the dough's surface and slice quickly and decisively about  1/2-inch deep. Spritz the loaves with water place them in the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 475 degrees. Bake the loaves for 18 to 24 minutes. Remove the loaves from the oven when they're a deep golden brown and transfer them to a rack to cool.

Pork Belly Tacos,DeLille Cellars,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Pork Belly Tacos,1 serving,  Pork Belly Marinade:  1/2 cup of one's favorite BBQ sauce 12 oz bottle of beer 1 tablespoon chili powder  3/4 teaspoon garlic powder  3/4 teaspoon onion powder  3/4 teaspoon red pepper   3/4 teaspoon oregano  1/2 teaspoon paprika  1/2 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon salt  1 teaspoon pepper  Tomatillos Puree: 8 tomatillos roasted or grilled until marked soft and juicy  1/2 bunch fresh cilantro Salt to taste  Condiments: 2 roasted peeled and seeded Anaheim peppers cut into thin strips 4 thinly sliced radishes Cilantro/red onion mixture Cup of chopped cabbage Hot sauce (optional)  12 (8-inch) fresh flour or corn tortillas   , I rarely pass up pork belly on any menu so when I discovered you could make pork belly tacos I flipped.  This is my version and the rich spicy generous flavors of the 2013 DeLille Cellars AIX goes perfectly with this dish.  Prepare the pork belly.  The belly needs to be in boneless skinless strips that are about 1.5 inches wide and 6 inches long.  If you buy a slab then you should cut it into strips.  You can easily remove the skin by making a slit at one end then running your knife along the skin and holding the belly secure as you move the knife away from your hand.  Mix the beer with the BBQ sauce and seasoning.  Line up your pork belly strips in a baking dish and pour the sauce over them.  Place this dish in an oven at 325 degrees F for about 3 1/2 hours until the meat is very tender.  Allow the belly to cool for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the pan and cut into cubes.  While the pork belly is cooking roast the tomatillos and Anaheim peppers.  Slice the Anaheim peppers into strips and set aside.  Blend the roasted tomatillos and cilantro in a blender or food processor.  Salt to taste.  Set aside.  Thinly slice the radishes.  Chop  1/2 large red onion and  1/2 bunch of cilantro and mix. Set aside.  Heat the tortillas in a dry hot frying pan or griddle for about 15 seconds per side.  To Serve: assemble your tacos by filling a tortilla with a few pork cubes and a few strips of roasted Anaheim peppers.  Add a teaspoon of the onion cilantro mixture and about a table spoon of chopped cabbage.  Add a couple of the radish slices and about a tablespoon of the tomatillo puree.

Slowly braising the bird in red wine makes it tender and delicious. While Burgundy wine is traditional here use a fruit-forward Syrah for a taste of the Rh&#244;ne Valley.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees and place a rack in the bottom third. Place bacon in a large Dutch oven on the stovetop and heat over moderate heat. Cook bacon until crispy and fat has rendered about 8 to 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or spider transfer bacon to a paper-towel lined plate leaving the fat in the Dutch oven.  Season the chicken pieces generously on all sides with salt and pepper. Using tongs place chicken in the Dutch oven and cook to a deep brown on all sides about 8 to 10 minutes working in batches as needed. Transfer chicken to a rimmed baking sheet.  Add onion carrot celery and leek to Dutch oven and cook stirring occasionally until vegetables are browned about 8 to 10 minutes.

Cook until wine mixture begins to thicken about 4 to 5 minutes. Return chicken to Dutch oven along with any juices from the baking sheet and add enough stock to barely cover the chicken. Add thyme bay leaves and peppercorns stirring to combine. Cover the Dutch oven and place in the preheated oven. Cook the chicken until fork-tender and an inserted instant read thermometer registers at least 165 degrees about 50 to 60 minutes.   While the chicken is cooking boil the pearl onions in rapidly boiling salted water until tender about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and let cool then trim ends with a paring knife and peel. Set aside.  In a large roasting pan place butter and oil. Add onions and mushrooms and stir to combine. Drizzle with sherry vinegar and season liberally with salt and pepper. Place roasting pan in oven with the Dutch oven and cook stirring occasionally until onions and mushrooms turn golden brown and most of the liquid has evaporated about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove roasting pan from oven and place onions and mushrooms in a medium bowl. Set aside.  Remove Dutch oven from oven and using tongs carefully transfer the chicken to a rimmed baking sheet and cover loosely with foil to keep warm.  Strain the cooking liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a large saucepan pressing solids with a wooden spoon to release as much liquid as possible. Place saucepan over high heat and cook the liquid until reduced and thickened about 10 to 12 minutes skimming the surface with a heatproof ladle to remove any excess fat. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.  To serve: Place one piece of chicken in 8 individual shallow serving bowls and ladle sauce over each. Garnish with pearl onions and mushrooms and sprinkle with reserved bacon pieces and thyme leaves. Serve immediately.

Sally's Turkey Bone and Stuffing Dumpling Soup,Recipe courtesy of Scraps,home/recipes/soups-stews/meat-poultry/Sally's Turkey Bone and Stuffing Dumpling Soup,10 servings  Learn more about Scraps ,  Soup: 1 leftover turkey carcass and bones plus 2 pounds leftover turkey meat divided 4-6 cups leftover assorted raw vegetable scraps (such peels ends and trim from onions carrots celery root vegetables and/or herbs) Up to 6 cups assorted pan scrapings from Thanksgiving dinner such as mashed potatoes stuffing green bean casserole gravy vegetables even a slice of pie!  Leftover Stuffing Dumplings: 3 cups leftover stuffing 1 egg 2 teaspoons baking powder Chopped fresh parsley for garnish  , Make the broth: In a large stockpot add the turkey carcass raw vegetable scraps and side dish scraps. Cover with water. Bring to a boil then partially cover and simmer on low for at least 12 hours (and up to 24).   Strain the broth: Carefully strain soup through a large fine-mesh strainer or chinois into a large clean soup pot. Bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper if needed.   Shred the turkey: Meanwhile put turkey meat in the bowl of your KitchenAid&#174; Stand Mixer fitted with flat beater attachment. On Speed 2 mix turkey until just shredded about 10 seconds. Stir turkey into soup.    Make the dumplings: In the same mixing bowl on Speed 2 add stuffing eggs and baking powder. Mix until combined.   Cook the dumplings: Using a spoon drop 2" balls of dough over the surface of stew (don’t worry if they aren’t perfect). Cover and cook until dumplings have puffed and feel firm about 15-20 minutes. Garnish with parsley before serving.    Notes: Everything yes everything goes in this soup! It may sound crazy to simmer all those side dish scraps into your soup. The key to this soup is simmering on low heat for hours. It gives everything time to meld together and the flavors to marry.  To get extra scrappy do like Sally does and start the soup in the same stock pot used to mash your potatoes. If you have any other pans leftover from preparing the meal add a bit of water to each and scrape up the bits leftover. The dregs will add even more flavor to your soup!   Sally sometimes simmers chunks of carrots in the final strained soup. She also has been known to put cooked bowtie pasta in each bowl of soup (if you choose to do this omit the dumplings).

Add eggs a tablespoon at a time beating well between each addition and scraping down the sides as needed. Add date purée and mix lightly. Stir in flour baking powder and salt. The mixture will be quite sloppy.  Divide evenly between the 6 prepared custard cups about 4 ounces in each cup.  Each cup should be just over half full. Using the back of a spoon make a hollow in the center to allow for even baking without a dome. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes or until risen and golden.  Allow to stand for 5 minutes and then run a butter knife or small offset spatula around inside to loosen cake. Invert onto serving plate. Cut off any risen tops if necessary.

Asparagus and Chopped Egg with Meyer Lemon Olive Oil,Things Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Marie Simmons photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Asparagus and Chopped Egg with Meyer Lemon Olive Oil,4 to 8 servings,  4 large eggs  1/2 pound asparagus 1 cup ice cubes Coarse salt  1/2 red onion 1 tablespoon packed fresh tarragon leaves plus 4 small sprigs for garnish 3 tablespoons Meyer lemon olive oil 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed Meyer lemon or regular lemon juice Freshly ground black pepper 12 Bibb or other small lettuce leaves rinsed and dried 10 small plum tomatoes quartered for garnish   , This recipe while not traditionally Italian illustrates the versatility of the mezzaluna. It is used to chop every element: the hard-cooked eggs the asparagus and the tarragon. The salad which can be served as a first course or side dish is dressed with Meyer lemon–infused olive oil. If you don’t live where Meyer lemons grow a bottle of Meyer lemon infused olive oil is the next best thing. The lemons which are especially fragrant juicy and sweet are thought to be a cross between a regular lemon and a mandarin orange.  Put the eggs in a 2-quart saucepan and add cold water to cover. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a gentle boil. Remove from the heat cover and let stand for 15 minutes. Pour off the hot water and rinse the eggs with cold water until they are cool. Crack the shells against the sides of the pan and let the eggs stand in the water for 10 minutes. Drain the eggs peel and set aside.  While the eggs are standing trim the tough stem ends from the asparagus and use a serrated peeler to remove the scales from the lower section of the stalks. Fill a wide bowl with water and add the ice cubes. Pour water to a depth of 1 inch into a 3- quart saute pan or a deep skillet and bring to a boil. Add the asparagus and 1 teaspoon salt and cook for 3 minutes or until crisp-tender. Lift the asparagus from the water with tongs and plunge into the iced water. Let stand for 2 minutes and drain.  Two at a time coarsely chop the eggs with the mezzaluna on a mezzaluna cutting board or a standard cutting board and transfer to a large bowl. Coarsely chop the onion and add to the bowl with the eggs. Alternatively chop the eggs and the onion with a chef's knife.  Pat the asparagus dry with paper towels. Place the spears a few at a time on the cutting board and cut into randomly sized  3/4 to 1-inch slices with the mezzaluna. Add to the eggs. Put the tarragon leaves on the board chop finely and add to the eggs. Or cut the asparagus and the tarragon with the chef's knife.  Drizzle the eggs and asparagus with the olive oil and lemon juice and sprinkle with  1/2 teaspoon salt and a grinding of pepper. Using a rubber spatula fold gently to blend.  Arrange the lettuce leaves on individual plates or a platter and spoon the salad on top. Garnish with the tomatoes and tarragon sprigs.   
Bread and Butter Pickles,Katy Hume Sur La Table,home/recipes/seasonal/farmers-market-recipes/Bread and Butter Pickles,about 4 ( 1/2-pint) jars,  1 1/2 lbs pickling cucumbers cut into  1/2-inch slices 2 medium onions thinly sliced  3/4 cup pickling salt 3 cups cold water 1 cup brown sugar 1 tbsp mustard seed  1/2 tsp celery seed  1/2 tsp cloves  1/2 tsp turmeric 1 1/2 cups cider vinegar 5% acidity Ball 100% Natural Pickle Crisp optional  ,  Start pickles: Combine cucumber slices onion slices salt and water in a large bowl. Mix well. Cover and let stand 2 hours.  Sterilize jars and lids: Wash jars screw bands and lids in hot soapy water then rinse well. Dry screw bands. Put jars on a rack in a boiling-water canner or a deep 8- to 10-quart pot and add enough hot water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil covered with lid and boil 10 minutes. Heat lids in water to cover in a small saucepan until thermometer registers 180 degrees F (do not let boil). Keep jars and lids submerged in hot water covered until ready to use.  Finish pickles: Combine remaining ingredients in a large saucepot. Bring to a boil stirring occasionally. Drain vegetables; rinse. Drain again. Add vegetables to vinegar mixture and return to a boil. Drain jars upside down on a clean kitchen towel 1 minute. Pack hot pickles and pickling liquid into hot jars leaving  3/4" headspace. Add  3/4 teaspoon Pickle Crisp to each jar after it is filled. Remove air bubbles with a nonmetallic spatula.  Seal and process jars: Wipe off rims of filled jars with a clean damp kitchen towel then screw on lids with screw band just until a point of resistance is met - fingertip tight. Put sealed jars on rack in canner or pot and add enough hot water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil covered. Boil pickles covered 10 minutes then transfer jars with tongs to a towel-lined surface to cool. Jars will seal (if you hear a ping that signals that the vacuum formed at the top has made the lid concave).  After jars have cooled 12 to 24 hours press center of each lid to check that it's concave then remove screw band and try to lift lid with your fingertips. If you can't the lid has a good seal.

A relative of mint it has quite a different flavor grassy-earthy with almost a touch of lemon. It can be hard to find in stores but it makes a great garden herb if you have some space for it. You can use mint instead for equally refreshing results.” - Reprinted with permission from Oysters: Recipes that Bring Home a Taste of the Sea by Cynthia Nims copyright &#169; 2016.

Herbed Chicken Pot Pie,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/Herbed Chicken Pot Pie,1 (9-inch) deep-dish pie,  1 recipe Flaky Pie or Tart Dough prepared through Step 5  3/4 stick (3 ounces) unsalted butter 1 cup (5 1/2 ounces) diced onion about 1 medium  1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) diced celery about 2 stalks 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 4 cups (1 quart) homemade chicken stock or canned low-sodium chicken broth  1/2 cup (3 ounces) peeled and diced carrot about 1 medium 1 tablespoon olive oil 10 ounces sliced mushrooms 1 pound cooked chicken meat diced 1 cup (5 ounces) frozen peas 1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives 1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley 1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme Salt Black pepper 1 large egg yolk 2 tablespoons milk or cream   , This savory favorite is easier than ever to make thanks to the roasted chicken and chopped vegetables available in most markets. The recipe can be made in individual pie pans or bowls as well though you may need to prepare a double recipe of dough to ensure you have enough to top each serving. Don't substitute dried herbs here&#45;they won't give you the dynamic flavor that fresh ones offer.  Transfer the circle of pie or tart dough to a baking sheet and chill until ready to use.  Melt the butter over medium heat in the saucepan. Add the onion and celery and cook stirring occasionally with the spatula for 5 to 7 minutes until softened. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the flour. Whisk vigorously to blend the flour with the vegetables and butter. Return to the heat and cook whisking for 2 to 3 minutes (do not let the flour brown). Remove the pan from the heat. Add about 1 cup of the stock and whisk until the mixture is smooth and pastelike. This is your only chance to remove any lumps of flour so whisk thoroughly. Once the paste is smooth whisk in the remaining stock. Return the pan to the heat and bring to a boil whisking frequently. Add the carrots. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.  Fill the large bowl halfway with ice and water and set it aside. Heat the olive oil in the saute pan over high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook stirring every 2 to 3 minutes until deep golden brown 10 to 12 minutes. Add the mushrooms to the filling along with the chicken peas chives parsley and thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set the saucepan into the bowl of ice water. Stir occasionally until the filling is cool. (Chilling the filling prevents the flaky pastry from melting when it's placed on top of the pie.) Scrape the filling into the pie pan.  Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Brush the edge of the pie pan with a thin film of water. Transfer the dough to the pan roll the edges to form a thick rope along the edge of the pan then crimp or form a decorative border as desired. Any leftover pie dough can be used to make decorative designs such as a chicken on top of the pie crust. In a small bowl beat the egg yolk with the milk or cream and use the pastry brush to lightly glaze the surface of the pie. 5 Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown and crisp. Transfer to a rack and let cool for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve hot spooning filling and crust into wide shallow bowls.  Storing: Any leftovers may be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 4 days. Reheat in a 375&deg;F oven for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.   
Lattice-Top Apple-Cranberry Pie,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Lattice-Top Apple-Cranberry Pie,1 (9-inch) pie,  Cranberry filling: 1 1/2 cups chopped cranberries fresh or frozen 1 cup granulated sugar  1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  1/3 cup orange or cranberry juice  All-purpose flour for dusting work surface 2 recipes Perfect Pie Crust   Apple filling: 3 large tart apples peeled cored and cut into  3/4-inch thick slices 1 tablespoon ( 1/2 ounce) cold unsalted butter cut into pieces  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  1 egg yolk 2 teaspoons granulated sugar   , A lattice top always raises a double crust pie to another level. One trick is to work out your lattice on a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and then slide it into place on top of your filling. You can also freeze the lattice tops like this so you can defrost and slide onto another pie at a later date.  Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F and position a rack in the center of the oven.   For the cranberry filling: In a medium saucepan cook the cranberries sugar orange zest flour and juice over medium heat until the mixture simmers and is slightly thickened about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool.   To prepare pie: Lightly flour a work surface and draw a 12-inch circle in the flour. This guide will be the perfect size for a standard 9-inch pie dish. Place 1 recipe of pie crust in the center of the circle and dust a little flour on top. Using the circle as a guide roll out the dough into a 12-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over a 9-inch pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang. Trim the dough so that it overhangs by 1-inch. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.   To prepare lattice: Lightly flour a work surface and draw a 14-inch by 12-inch rectangle in the flour. This guide will be the perfect size for the lattice strips. Firmly shape the remaining 1 recipe of pastry dough into a small rectangle and roll out to a 14-inch by 12-inch rectangle about  1/8-inch thick. Use a pastry wheel pizza cutter or kitchen knife to cut the dough into fourteen 1-inch wide strips. If the strips of dough are warm and difficult to move chill them on a baking sheet for 10 minutes.   To assemble the pie: Place the apples on top of the dough in pie plate then dot with butter and sprinkle with cinnamon. Pour the cooled cranberry mixture over the apples.  Lay 7 of the lattice strips evenly spaced horizontally across the apples. Working from the right side fold back every other strip (4 strips in total) so that they are doubled back on themselves. Lay a vertical strip of dough next to this new fold. The new strip should be parallel to and  1/2-inch from the first vertical strip. Repeat twice more until half of the pie has been latticed. Turn the pie so that un-latticed side faces you and continue weaving in the same manner until all the strips have been used.

Grilled Steak and Herbed Potatoes with Lemon Aioli,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Grilled Steak and Herbed Potatoes with Lemon Aioli,4 servings,  Marinade:  2 medium garlic cloves 1 tablespoon chopped rosemary 1 tablespoon dried oregano 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard  1/3 cup balsamic vinegar  2/3 cup olive oil Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper  Steak:  1  1/2 pounds flank steak 1  1/2 pounds fingerling potatoes scrubbed Vegetable oil for grilling  Aioli:  2 large egg yolks 1 medium garlic clove chopped  1/2 cup vegetable oil  3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon sea salt  1 teaspoon lemon zest 1 to 2 teaspoons lemon juice   2 to 3 teaspoons water if needed 1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley for garnish   , Step up your grilling game by grilling your potatoes too and serving a homemade aioli sauce alongside for dipping.    For the marinade: In a blender or food processor combine all the marinade ingredients and puree smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Pour half the marinade into a large bowl and set aside for grilling the potatoes.   Arrange the steak in a glass baking dish pour remaining marinade over the meat and turn to coat completely. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate for at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours. (Alternatively use a vacuum sealer or instant marinator to reduce the marination time by half.)   For the potatoes: Place potatoes in a large pot cover with 2 inches of water and season with salt. Place pot over medium-high heat just until water begins to boil. Immediately reduce heat to maintain a steady simmer. Cook potatoes until tender about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and arrange on a rimmed baking sheet to cool slightly. When cool slice potatoes in half lengthwise and combine in the large bowl with the marinade. Toss to coat potatoes evenly and season with sea salt and pepper. Set aside at room temperature.  To prepare the lemon aioli: Crush garlic into a paste in a medium to large mortar and pestle. Add the egg yolks to the garlic and stir mixture rapidly while drizzling in oil. (Alternatively this process works well in a small food processor or a heavy mixing bowl with a soft whisk.) When all the oil is combined the aioli will be very thick. To finish add salt lemon zest and 1 teaspoon juice. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and additional lemon juice. Adjust consistency with water as needed.  To grill the flank steak: Allow flank to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade letting the excess drip off; transfer steak to a plate and season with salt and pepper.  Using a silicone brush lightly coat grill with oil. Place steak on the grill and cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 130°F for medium-rare about 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer steak to a cutting board loosely tent with foil and allow steak to rest for 5 minutes before carving. (The steak will continue to cook after it is removed from the grill. For steaks carryover cooking can account for an added 5 degrees of internal temperature during resting).     Using tongs and letting the excess marinade drip off place potatoes on the grill cut sides down. Cook until dark grill marks are achieved about 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the potatoes and cook another 2 to 3 minutes until hot.    To serve: Slice the steak thinly against the grain and arrange on a warmed platter. Arrange potatoes around the steak garnish with parsley and serve with lemon aioli on the side.

3 ways to make vegetable chips (that taste great),Philips,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/3 ways to make vegetable chips (that taste great),1 serving,  Sweet Potatoes Carrots Parsnips Zucchini Beets Kale Salt Pepper Spices or herbs of your choice  , Colorful delicious and the ideal party snack to cater for nearly all dietary needs - vegetable chips. Whether you are planning to use carrots beets turnips zucchini or the traditional potato veggie chips are easy to make right at home. And once you set them out in front of your guests they'll be gone in no time!  Here are three simple methods for making veggie chips: with the oven the microwave and the air fryer. If you already have the ingredients at home you could be eating homemade veggie chips within the hour. It's that easy!   Tips for vegetable chips: Preparation (Takes about 20 minutes)  There's a good chance you already have everything you need for making veggie chips. If you have unused vegetables lying around it's time to turn them into a delicious snack. You can make chips out of sweet potatoes carrots parsnips zucchini beets or even kale.   If you're expecting guests try making chips from a few different vegetables. It won't take much more work than if you were to just use one vegetable and it will make the final dish that much more colorful and interesting. It's also a great conversation starter!    Follow these tips for preparing different types of homemade veggie chips:   For beet chips you'll first need to remove any excess moisture from the vegetable. After slicing toss your chips in a small amount of salt and oil so as to simultaneously season and draw out excess moisture. If you'd rather not use salt you can layer your sliced beets between sheets of kitchen paper to soak up the moisture.  The method for making beet chips also works for other root chips such as sweet potato russet potato parsnips and carrots. For root chips or other starchy vegetables you can get your chips to turn out crispier by soaking the veggie slices in ice water for twenty minutes. Rinse them thoroughly afterwards. This should get rid of some of the starch.    For zucchini chips you're likely to be dealing with more moisture. Squeeze as much as you can out of the slices with paper towels and leave them to dry for a bit longer between the sheets.    If you're making kale chips break the kale into chip-sized chunks and wash thoroughly. To dry your kale chips dab with kitchen paper or use a salad spinner.    From measuring the ingredients to watching the perfect pasta be extruded from your pasta maker making fresh pasta can be a wonderfully relaxing pastime to enjoy with the whole family. Whether by hand or by machine the first step in learning how to make homemade ravioli is good dough. Let's get to it!   Regardless of the method you use for making veggie chips you'll need salt pepper and spices or herbs of your choice. Caraway seeds fennel seeds rosemary and chili powder are all solid bets. Experiment with a few seasoning combinations and you'll end up with a vegetable chips recipe that works for you. Check out our flavorful beet chips recipe for some inspiration!   If you want your chips to have some bite you can use a little olive oil. It'll make them crunchier without compromising on the taste. And if you'd prefer not to use oil no problem! You can still have delicious vegetable chips by using the air fryer method (more on this method to come).

Pork Medallion Saute with Figs,Things Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Marie Simmons photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Pork Medallion Saute with Figs,4 servings,  12 figs fresh or dried (see headnote) 1 cup dry Marsala 1 1/2 pork tenderloins (about 1 3/4 pounds total) Coarse salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme About  1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  1/2 cup finely chopped shallots 1 to 2 tablespoons fig balsamic or regular aged balsamic vinegar Thyme sprigs cut into 1-inch pieces for garnish   , Make this dish with fresh figs when they’re in season. Green-skinned figs are the prettiest as the purple ones tend to tint the sauce a rosy pink. If it isn’t fig season use either dried Black Mission or the lighter-skinned Calimyrna. For the pan sauce use an inexpensive dry Marsala a fortified Italian wine.  Snip the stems from the figs with kitchen scissors. Cut the small figs into halves or the large ones into quarters. Set aside. If using dried figs place them in a small saucepan with the Marsala and heat gently until warmed. Set aside to soak while preparing the pork cutlets.  Remove the silverskin from the pork tenderloin: Lay the whole tenderloin on a cutting board and trim any excess fat. Locate the silverskin which is a long narrow shiny  white membrane that runs along the surface of the meat. With the tip of a thin sharp knife make a small cut at the top of the silverskin long enough for you to hold onto the skin with the fingertips of one hand. With the other hand pull the knife its blade leaning toward the skin along the skin and parallel to the meat to separate it from the meat. Discard the skin. Repeat with the half tenderloin. Slice the tenderloins into 12 slices each  3/4 inch thick.  Cut 2 sheets of plastic wrap each about 10 inches long. Lay 2 or 3 tenderloin slices on 1 sheet and cover with the second sheet. Gently pound the slices until evenly flattened to between 1&frasl;8 and  3/4 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining slices. When all of the slices have been pounded into cutlets sprinkle them lightly on both sides with salt and pepper then sprinkle them on one side only with 1 teaspoon of the chopped thyme. Place the flour on a sheet of plastic wrap and dip each cutlet in the flour lightly coating on both sides and shaking off the excess.  Heat a 10- to 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and oil and heat until the butter foams. Add the pork a few slices at a time and saute turning once with tongs for 1 to 2 minutes per side or until lightly browned. Using the tongs transfer to a plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining pork slices.  Add the shallots to the pan and saute over medium-low heat stirring for 3 minutes or until softened. If the dried figs are soaking strain and reserve the Marsala separately. Add the figs increase the heat to medium-high and cook turning them with a spatula as they brown for about 3 minutes (turn fresh figs gently as stirring might crush them). Add the Marsala and boil gently turning the fruit for about 3 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the vinegar and the remaining 1 teaspoon of chopped thyme on top. Taste and add more vinegar if needed. Season the sauce with salt and pepper. Return the pork to the pan and quickly reheat turning the pork in the sauce.  Arrange the pork slices on a warmed platter and spoon the figs and sauce on top. Garnish with the thyme sprigs and serve at once.

Mango and Chipotle Chile Guacamole,Things Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Marie Simmons photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/appetizers/dips-spreads-sauces-seasonings/Mango and Chipotle Chile Guacamole,4 to 6 servings,  2 sprigs cilantro coarsely chopped  3/4 cup chopped white onion 1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce plus 1 to 2 teaspoons adobo sauce 1 clove garlic  1/2 teaspoon coarse salt 2 large ripe avocados halved pitted and scooped from skins 1 to 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice 1 ripe mango peeled pitted and cut into  3/4-inch dice Tortillas chips warm flour tortillas or raw vegetables (such as cucumber carrot red bell pepper or celery) for serving   , In modern Mexico making guacamole in a molcajete is reserved for special occasions. But anyone who has eaten guacamole made the traditional way insists that its texture and taste are superior to its counterpart made with any other tool especially the food processor. If you don't have a molcajete mash the ingredients with the back of a fork or a potato masher and finely chop the onion garlic and chipotle before adding them. Or use any large mortar and pestle.  Place the cilantro onion chipotle garlic and salt in a molcajete or other mortar and mash until blended and the mixture becomes a paste. Alternatively finely chop together all the ingredients and place in a bowl.  Add the avocado lime juice and adobo sauce to taste and roughly mash with the tejolote until the avocado is coarse but creamy and the mixture is blended. Alternatively use a potato masher pastry blender or the back of a fork to make a coarse creamy mixture. Using a small rubber spatula gently fold in the mango.  Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt. Serve directly from the molcajete or transfer to a deep wide serving bowl. Serve with tortilla chips or raw vegetables.   
Pastry Dough,Sur La Table Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/breads/dough/Pastry Dough,1 (9-inch) pie crust,  1- 3/4 cups all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  1/2 cup unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes   , A classic recipe that's great for savory or sweet pies from meat-filled empanadas to apple turnovers. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month. You can also save more time by making the dough in the food processor. Place the flour and cold butter in the processor bowl and pulse to cut the butter into the flour then transfer to a large mixing bowl and proceed with the recipe. Make sure to weigh your ingredients for best results.  To make the dough: Either place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl or into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. If using a mixing bowl use a pastry blender two knives or your fingers to cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring.  If using a food processor add the cut butter to the flour and pulse mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Drizzle in ice water and pulse until the flour holds together.   Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.   
Dutch Oven Bread,Le Creuset,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Dutch Oven Bread,1 loaf,  4 cups flour 1 1/2 cups water 1 teaspoon active dry yeast Kosher salt or coarse sea salt Vegetable oil or vegetable oil spray Olive oil   , Combine the flour water yeast and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on medium speed until the dough is smooth and elastic 5 to 10 minutes. Depending on the size of the bowl you may need to stop the mixer and remove the dough from the dough hook if the dough is not developing thoroughly. When the dough looks smooth cut off a piece and stretch it. If it stretches to the point of transparency it's mixed enough. If not continue mixing.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and cover it with a pot lid or plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise until it has doubled in size and does not spring back when you push your finger into it 2 to 4 hours.  Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead it to release the gas and redistribute the yeast. Shape it roughly into a ball cover it with a towel and let stand for 10 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.  Shape the dough into a tight ball-the tighter the better-by rolling it on the work surface between your palms.  Spray or coat the bottom and sides of a large Dutch oven or other heavy ovenproof pot (5  1/2 quarts or larger) with vegetable oil. Put the dough in the center of the pot and place the lid on. Allow the dough to rise again 30 to 60 minutes (less if it's very hot and humid more if it's cold).  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.  Rub 1 tablespoon olive oil or more if you like gently over the surface of the dough. Score the bread with a sharp knife or razor making an X or a hash mark; this will allow the dough to expand freely. Sprinkle the dough with salt. Cover the pot and place it in the oven.  After 30 minutes remove the lid reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and continue baking until the bread is nicely browned and cooked through. It should have an internal temperature of 200 degrees F or so when done.  Allow the bread to rest on a rack for at least 30 minutes so that the interior finishes cooking.  Note: Only our Signature phenolic knobs and stainless steel knobs are oven-safe at this temperature. Classic phenolic knobs are oven-safe to 375 degrees F. If using a Classic oven remove the knob when baking at temperatures higher than 375 degrees F.

Red Lentil Soup with Coconut Milk and Spinach,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/soups-stews/grains-legumes-pasta/Red Lentil Soup with Coconut Milk and Spinach,6 servings,   1 medium yellow onion diced (about 1 cup)  2 tablespoons coconut or peanut oil 4 garlic cloves smashed Kosher salt 3 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger divided 2 teaspoons mustard seeds 2 teaspoons ground turmeric 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground fennel  3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 3 1/2 cups water 14-ounce can coconut milk 1 cup red lentils rinsed 6 ounces (about 6 cups) baby spinach roughly chopped 2 tablespoons lime juice Unsweetened coconut flakes and chopped tomato to garnish (optional)     ,  Our red lentil soup is a simplified spin on a Goan staple. Split red lentils the foundation of the dish cook in minutes making this a quick weeknight meal. The blend of coriander fennel and turmeric capture the essence of the dish's complex spicing without requiring the cook to pull out half the spice cabinet. A shot of lime juice cuts through the starchiness. Fresh ginger added welcome brightness and adding a portion of it at the end kept the flavor vibrant; grating the ginger on a wand-style grater was best. If you can't find ground fennel grind whole seeds in a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder. Both virgin and refined coconut oil worked but virgin had a slightly stronger flavor. Yellow and brown mustard seeds both were good.   Don't substitute brown or green lentils for the split red lentils. Red lentils break down as they cook thickening the cooking liquid and providing the ideal texture for this soup. Other lentil varieties remain intact even when fully cooked.   In a Durotherm over medium-high (if using gas don't let the flames reach the sides of the pot) combine the onion oil garlic and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Cook stirring until the onions have softened and are just beginning to color 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in 2 teaspoons of the ginger the mustard seeds turmeric coriander fennel and pepper flakes. Cook stirring until fragrant about 1 minute. Add the water coconut milk and lentils then cover and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 7 minutes.  Without removing the lid transfer the pot from the stove to the heat retaining base. Allow soup to sit covered for at least 15 minutes to finish cooking.

Traditional Art of the Pie All-Butter Dough,Kate McDermott and Andrew Scrivani,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Traditional Art of the Pie All-Butter Dough,one double-crust pie or two single-crust pies,  2 1/2 cups (363 grams) all-purpose flour unbleached (use dip and sweep method)  1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) salt 14 tablespoons (196 grams) salted or unsalted butter cut into tablespoon-size pieces  1/2 cup (118 grams) ice water + 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 grams) more as needed Additional flour for rolling out dough   , An all-butter crust is not as flaky as a butter and leaf lard crust but the flavor can't be beat.  Put all ingredients but the ice water in a large bowl.  With clean hands quickly smoosh the mixture together or use a pastry blender with an up and down motion until the ingredients look like cracker crumbs with lumps the size of peas and almonds. These lumps will make your crust flaky.  Sprinkle ice water over the mixture and stir lightly with a fork.  Squeeze a handful of dough to see if it holds together. Mix in more water as needed.  Divide the dough in half and make two chubby discs about 5 inches (12 centimeters) across.  Wrap the discs separately in plastic wrap and chill for about an hour.  Rolling Instructions:  Take out the dough discs and let them temper until they feel slightly soft to the touch and easy to roll out. Unwrap one disc and place it on a well-floured board pastry cloth parchment paper or plastic wrap.  Sprinkle some flour onto the top of the disc. Thump the disc with your rolling pin several times. Turn it over and thump the other side.  Sprinkle more flour onto the top of the dough as needed to keep the pin from sticking and roll the crust out from the center in all directions.  When the dough is 1 to 2 inches (3 to 5 centimeters) larger than your pie pan brush off the extra flour on both sides.  Fold the dough over the top of the pin and lay it in the pie pan carefully.  Don't worry if the crust needs to be patched together. Paint a little water where it needs to be patched and “glue” on the patch piece.  Put the filling in the pie and repeat the process with the other disc.   Making traditional dough in a food processor:  Chill the work bowl and blade.  Put flour salt and fat into the chilled work bowl just as you would if doing it by hand.  Pulse 15 times.  Add 4 tablespoons of ice water.  Pulse 10 more times.  Add 4 more tablespoons of ice water.  Pulse 5 more times.  Turn the ingredients into a bowl add more ice water as needed and finish off by hand.  
Homemade Custard-Style Yogurt,Br&oslash;d & Taylor,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Homemade Custard-Style Yogurt,8 (8-ounce) servings,  8 cups (half gallon) milk 4 tablespoons plain yogurt with live cultures ( 3/4 cup)   , This recipe makes thick and creamy homemade yogurt without the need for additives like gelatin or powdered milk. Two techniques are featured for creating thick yogurt: the first is holding the milk at 195 degrees F for ten minutes and the second is the High-Low method. This method starts the yogurt hot to speed culturing and provide the most food-safe conditions then switches to a low temperature to form a creamy texture and avoid the watery lumpy texture that can come from culturing too hot.    Prep time: Active preparation time is 20 minutes. Total elapsed time is about 4 to 5 hours.    Equipment: Br&#248;d & Taylor Folding Proofer thermometer glass mason jars or other lidded heat-proof containers with a capacity of one quart or less. Everything that will touch the milk should be thoroughly clean and dry.  Heat milk to 195 degrees F and hold for 10 minutes: Using either a microwave or the stovetop heat milk to 195 degrees F. If using the stovetop stir frequently to prevent scorching. Hold the temperature of the milk above 195 degrees F for ten minutes. (Tip: Whisking the milk to cover the surface with bubbles will prevent a skin from forming during heating and cooling.)  Cool milk to 115 degrees F: Remove the milk from the heat and allow to cool to at least 115 degrees F. While the milk is cooling set up the Proofer with the wire rack in place and the temperature at 120 degrees F.  Add yogurt: Put the yogurt with live cultures into a small bowl. Gradually stir in enough of the warm milk to liquefy the mixture and mix until smooth. Then pour the liquefied culture back into the large container of milk and stir gently to distribute. Pour into jars cover with lids and place in the Proofer. (Tip: For proper heat circulation and the most accurate culturing temperature arrange the jars so that they are not directly over the center of the Proofer.)  Proof culture at 120 degrees F for one hour then lower the heat to 86 degrees F: After one hour at 120 degrees F turn the Proofer down to 86 degrees F. It's important not to let the yogurt remain at 120'F for more than an hour in order to avoid the whey separation and lumpy texture that come from culturing too hot.  Check the yogurt after two hours: Tilt a jar to the side to see if the yogurt has set. Most yogurts will set in about 2 to 4 hours. The yogurt will be very mild when first set. If more flavor is desired culture longer at 86 degrees F. When the yogurt is ready put it into the refrigerator and allow it to chill thoroughly. Be sure to reserve enough yogurt to start your next batch.  When yogurt is ready to eat mix in your favorite fresh fruit or add a teaspoon of honey for a delicious and healthy treat.

Kabocha Squash Risotto with Crispy Pancetta,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Kabocha Squash Risotto with Crispy Pancetta,4 servings,  6 cups vegetable or chicken broth low-sodium  4 tablespoons olive oil divided  1 tablespoon unsalted butter  1 (2 pound) Kabocha squash peeled seeded and cut into  1/2-inch cubes  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 tablespoon minced sage leaves  4 ounces pancetta cut crosswise  1/2-inch slices  1 yellow onion minced   1/2 cup dry white wine  2 cups Arborio rice or Carnaroli rice   1/2 cup shaved Parmesan cheese    , Also known as "golden squash" this Asian variety of winter squash contains a strong yet sweet flavor and moist fluffy texture that perfectly complements the soft creamy risotto rice.  Pour the vegetable or chicken broth into a large saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. When boiling lower the heat to low cover the saucepan and keep the liquid hot. In case additional liquid is required fill an additional small saucepan with water and place on the stove over a high heat until boiling. Once boiling lower heat cover and keep hot.   Place a large nonstick skillet on the stove over a medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil. When the oil is shimmering add the squash and cook until golden-brown on the outside about 5 minutes.

Add the remaining stock  1/2 cup at a time stirring constantly and adding more broth only after the previous addition has been absorbed until the rice begins to pull away from the sides of the pan about 16 to 20 minutes.   Adjust the stove heat so the rice simmers rapidly throughout the cooking process. Use boiling water if broth has been used and rice requires more cooking time. The risotto is done when it is creamy and the grains are plump and tender with a slight resistance to the bite. Gently fold in the squash being careful not to over work. Taste and season with salt and pepper. If risotto is thick use any leftover broth or water to thin as needed.   To serve:  Ladle risotto into 4 warmed shallow serving bowls. Sprinkle with pancetta and serve immediately.   Alternate recipe: If you wish to include greens to this dish for color and texture  add 3 cups steamed Tuscan kale with leaves sliced crosswise to  3/4-inch thick.  When the risotto is done add the kale and cook until heated through about 2 minutes. Bold in flavor and texture Tuscan kale adds a wonderful contrast to the risotto rice.

Chicken and Preserved Lemon Tagine with Olives,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Chicken and Preserved Lemon Tagine with Olives,4 servings,  1 chicken about 1.25 kg/2 lb 12oz  3/4 tsp ground cinnamon  1 tbsp sunflower oil 1 large onion sliced 3 garlic cloves finely chopped 5 cm (2-inch) piece of root ginger peeled and grated A pinch of ground saffron or turmeric 500 ml/17 fl oz/2 cups hot chicken stock 1 bay leaf 2 wedges of preserved lemon rind rinsed and finely chopped 12 black olives 2 tbsp finely chopped coriander leaves Sea salt Couscous and preserved lemons for serving (optional)    ,  This simple one-pot tagine dances with flavour. You can steam the couscous over the broth as it cooks.  Put the chicken breast-side down on a chopping board. Using a small and very sharp knife cut through the skin between the thigh and the body. Twist the legs gently to remove them from the sockets. Turn the bird back over and ease the legs gently away from the body. Cut through the skin between the thigh and body as far around each leg as possible keeping the knife as close to the body as you can.  Pull the leg away from the body more vigorously and bend it back on itself so you expose the thigh joint and the ball breaks free of the socket. Cut between the ball and socket to release the leg and cut through any flesh still attached to the carcass. The "oyster" should still be attached to the thigh.  Place a leg skin-side up on a board and cut off the knuckle joint at the end of the drumstick. Feel and bend the joint joining the thigh to the drumstick to locate the gap in the bone. Cut through to split the leg into two. Repeat with the other drumstick and thigh.  Next take a breast and wing off the carcass in one piece. To do this make a cut through the skin and flesh running along either side of the cartilaginous ridge of the breastbone. Cut the breast meat back from the cavity end of the chicken down towards and under the wing joint keeping the knife as close to the carcass as possible. Finish by cutting through the joint where the wing is attached giving you a breast with its wing attached. Repeat with the other breast and wing.  Lay each of the breast-wing pieces skin-side up on the board and cut slightly on the diagonal into two leaving about one-third of the breast meat attached to the wing. Season with cinnamon and salt.  Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan over a medium-high heat and brown the chicken pieces skin-side down. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper. Add the onion to the pan cover and sweat for 2 to 3 minutes until translucent then add the garlic and ginger and cook for a further 1 minute until the fragrance is released.  Stir the saffron into the hot stock and return the chicken to the pan. Pour the stock over the chicken and add the bay leaf then cover and reduce the heat. Simmer for 30 minutes or until the meat is tender. Add the preserved lemon and olives to the pan and cook for another 10 minutes. Stir in the coriander and serve with couscous and lemon wedges if you like.

Za'atar Chicken with Lemon Yogurt,Dinner,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Za'atar Chicken with Lemon Yogurt,4 to 6 servings,  6 boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)  8 garlic cloves grated on a microplane or minced Grated zest and juice of 2 lemons 1 tablespoon za'atar 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley plus more for serving 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil plus more for serving 1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt  2/3 cup plain Greek yogurt preferably whole-milk  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Parsley leaves for garnish (optional)  Ground sumac for garnish (optional)  Pomegranate seeds for garnish (optional)  Mint leaves for garnish (optional)    ,  Intensely garlicky and lemony this Middle Eastern-inspired dish gets an earthy herbal character from za'atar a mix of dried herbs sumac and sesame seeds that's rubbed all over the boneless thighs along with garlic olive oil and plenty of fresh parsley. Don't be surprised at the number of garlic cloves called for here. Grated into a puree they melt into the chicken flesh thoroughly perfuming it without making it overwhelmingly pungent. These thighs work best cooked on the grill for maximum blackening at the edges. But they are still excellent under the broiler-just as long as you can get a deep smoky char on the meat.  In a large bowl combine the chicken with all but 1 teaspoon of the grated garlic (save that for the yogurt sauce) half of the lemon zest and juice and the za'atar parsley olive oil and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours.  Heat a grill or arrange a rack in the position closest to the heat source and heat the broiler.  Remove the chicken from the bowl reserving the marinade. If you are grilling grill the chicken over high heat until it is charred in spots 4 to 7 minutes. Baste the chicken with some of the reserved marinade flip the pieces over and continue cooking until they are just cooked through another 4 to 7 minutes. If you are broiling line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and spread the chicken out on it in a single layer. Broil the chicken basting it with some of the reserved marinade and turning the pieces over halfway through until well colored and charred in spots 4 to 7 minutes per side. Be careful that the chicken doesn't burn.  While the chicken cooks place the yogurt in a small bowl. Stir in the reserved grated garlic the remaining lemon zest the pepper and the remaining  3/4 teaspoon salt. To serve drizzle olive oil and the remaining lemon juice to taste over the chicken.

Soy sauce chow mein with a fried egg,Hetty McKinnon,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Soy sauce chow mein with a fried egg,4 servings,  7 ounces (200g) dried egg noodles Vegetable or other neutral oil  4 large eggs 7 ounces (200g) bean sprouts  2 scallions finely sliced  2 tablespoons toasted white sesame seeds  Sea salt and white pepper     Sauce   1 tablespoon light soy sauce or tamari 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce  2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil     Substitute    Dried egg noodles: 14 ounces (400 g) fresh noodles  Use rice vermicelli for gluten free    Veganize    Omit the egg   , This simple chow mein dish is most commonly served at dim sum restaurants where the noodles are fried on the spot in the traveling hot trolley. At home this is a breakfast staple made from scant pantry ingredients. I adore the addition of bean sprouts—I have vivid memories of my mum sitting in her cavernous armchair diligently tailing each sprout (a step I usually skip because I lack her dedication). My mum also adds garlic chives so when they are in season throw in a handful for a distinct aromatic flavor. The dark soy sauce adds the signature caramel color to the noodles—if you don't have any just use regular soy sauce or kecap manis. I've added a fried egg to amplify the breakfast feeling but you could also serve it with your favorite marinated egg (see page 33) or go without.  Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the noodles and stir to loosen them up. Cook according to the packet instructions until just tender about 2–4 minutes then rinse under cold running water until cold. Drain and set aside.  For the sauce mix together all the ingredients with 3 tablespoons of water in a small bowl.  Heat a wok or frying pan over high heat. When hot add a drizzle of oil then crack in one egg. Reduce the heat to medium and fry the egg until the edges are frizzled the white is set and the yolk is cooked to your liking. Season with a pinch of sea salt. Remove and repeat with the remaining eggs.  Place the wok or pan back over the heat and when hot add a drizzle of oil along with the noodles. Fry for 1–2 minutes then add the bean sprouts and the sauce. Toss well to coat the noodles thoroughly about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat season with white pepper and toss to combine.  To serve top with fried eggs scallions and sesame seeds.  To Asia With Love by Hetty McKinnon copyright &#169; 2021. Published by Prestel Publishing. Photography: Hetty McKinnon.

Chive Puffs with Smoked Salmon,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/appetizers/hot/Chive Puffs with Smoked Salmon,24 puffs,  Chive puffs: 8 tablespoons (4 ounces) unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces 1 cup (8 ounces) water  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour 4 large eggs plus 1 more if needed  3/4 cup (2 ounces) finely grated Gruyere cheese 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives 1 large egg beaten for egg wash  Smoked salmon filling:  3/4 cup mayonnaise 1- 1/2 tablespoons capers minced 2 teaspoons prepared horseradish 1- 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice 2 teaspoons minced flat-leaf parsley 8 ounces hot-smoked salmon crumbled Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper   , The base for these light and cheesy snacks is p&#226te a choux the same dough used to make profiteroles and eclairs. Even if you are intimidated by other pastry-making p&#226;te a choux is quick easy and low stress. It used to require strenuous beating by hand to blend the eggs into the dough but now it's simple: the stand mixer does all the work. The dough can be kept in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 days.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and position two racks in the top and lower thirds of the oven. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.  To prepare dough: Place the butter water and salt in a medium saucepan over low heat. Cook stirring from time to time with a wooden spoon so the butter melts evenly. When the butter has melted increase the heat and bring to a boil. Immediately remove the pan from the heat and add the flour all at once. Beat vigorously with the wooden spoon until the dough comes together in a mass around the spoon. Place the pan back over medium heat and continue to cook beating for another minute or so to dry out the dough-the pan will have a thin film of dough on the bottom.  Immediately transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed for 1 minute to slightly cool the dough and develop the gluten. With the mixer on medium speed add the eggs one at a time allowing each addition to blend completely into the dough before continuing. When all 4 eggs are incorporated the mixture should be shiny and elastic and stick to the side of the bowl. It should also pass the "string test:" place a bit of dough between your thumb and forefinger and pull them apart. The dough should form a stretchy string about 1- 1/2 to 2-inches long. If the dough has not reached this stage beat the extra egg and continue adding it a tablespoon at a time until the dough is finished. Stir in the grated Gruyere cheese and chives.   To pipe dough: Spoon the pastry dough into a pastry bag fitted with a  1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe the dough into 1-inch circles about  1/2- to  3/4-inch high. To stop the flow of dough from the pastry bag and disconnect it from the piped dough slice a lightly oiled paring knife across the opening of the tip.  To bake dough: Brush a light coating of beaten egg over the tops of the piped dough with a silicone pastry brush. Transfer to the oven to bake for 20 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F rotating the baking sheets between the racks and from front to back and continue to bake until the puffs are deep golden brown with no bubbling moisture visible around the sides about 25 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool.   To prepare the smoked salmon filling: Place the mayonnaise capers horseradish lemon juice parsley and smoked salmon in a large bowl and mix with a fork. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  To assemble: Using a sharp paring knife slice the puffs in half around the middle. Using a teaspoon fill the bottom of the puff with the smoked salmon mixture and place the lid on the top. Repeat with all puffs transfer to a platter and serve.    
Cioppino,Chef Mia Chambers,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Cioppino,4 to 6 servings,  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 yellow onion diced 1 small fennel bulb diced 3 cloves garlic minced  3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes more if you like it spicy 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 bay leaf Pinch of saffron threads Pinch of sea salt   1/2 cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes  4 cups seafood stock  1/2 pound littleneck clams scrubbed   3/4 pound mussels scrubbed and beards removed 1 1/2 pounds firm-fleshed fish fillets such as cod halibut or salmon cut into 2-inch cubes  1/2 pound large uncooked shrimp tails-on peeled and deveined Handful of parsley leaves chopped  1 loaf of sourdough or your favorite rustic loaf bread   , An Italian-American classic and a San Francisco tradition Cioppino owes its origins to the hearty seafood stews found up and down the coast of Italy. It’s a great do-ahead dish for feeding a crowd. The tomato broth can be made the day before refrigerated and will taste even better the next day when you heat it and add your seafood.  To make the broth heat the olive oil and butter in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Once the butter foams add the onion and fennel and saute stirring occasionally until softened about 5 minutes. Add the garlic red pepper flakes fennel seeds bay leaf saffron threads and a pinch of salt and saute until the garlic is fragrant about 2 minutes (watch your heat—don’t brown the garlic.)  Add the white wine and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Stir in the tomato paste diced tomatoes with their juice and stock. Bring to a boil; reduce to medium-low and simmer stirring occasionally until broth begins to thicken about 20 minutes.     Just before you are ready to eat stir the clams and mussels into the simmering broth. Cover the pot and cook until the clams and mussels begin to open about 5 minutes.  Stir in the fish and shrimp and cook until fish and shellfish are cooked through an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Discard any clams or mussels that don’t open. Ladle stew into bowls and garnish with a drizzle of olive oil and parsley.  Serve with thick slices of crusty bread to mop up the broth.  Photography © 2016 Joslyn Baker

Orange-Cardamom Marmalade,Gifts Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Diane Morgan photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/breakfast/jams-preserves/Orange-Cardamom Marmalade,11 ( 1/2-pint) jars of marmalade,  2 1/2 pounds (6 to 8 medium) oranges such as Valencia or Cara Cara  3/4 pound (about 2 large) lemons 6 cups cold water 20 green cardamom pods crushed 8 cups granulated sugar   , We tend to think of preserving and canning as a summertime activity and rightfully so with all the luscious berries and stone fruits in season; however in winter with the new crop of citrus in the market the timing is perfect for putting up marmalade and giving it as gifts for the holidays. Select blemish-free citrus preferably organically grown because for marmalade you use the fruit’s skin pith and flesh. The pith is naturally high in pectin as are the seeds which is why they are reserved tied in a cheesecloth bag and cooked along with the fruit. Cardamom is an aromatic spice that delicately perfumes the marmalade and adds a spicy-sweet flavor. The crushed cardamom pods and seeds are added to the bag containing the citrus seeds so they can easily be removed once the marmalade is done. Look for green cardamom at an Indian grocer or in a specialty store or order it online from a spice company such as Penzeys Spices (www.penzeys.com).  Prepare the fruit 12 to 24 hours before you plan to cook and preserve the marmalade. Wash and pat dry all the fruit. Trim and discard the stem ends. Cut the oranges and lemons into quarters and poke out all the seeds with the tip of a paring knife. Reserve the seeds in a small covered container. Using a sharp chef's knife or mandoline cut all the citrus including the rinds into 1&frasl;16-inch-thick slices. Put the sliced fruit in a large pot including any juices left on the cutting board. Add the 6 cups of water. Gently press down on the fruit to make sure it is submerged. Cover the pot and set aside at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours. (This softens the rinds and releases the pectin.)  The next day bring the pot of sliced fruit and water to a boil over medium-high heat. Adjust the heat so the mixture boils steadily without splattering and cook for 30 minutes. Wrap the crushed cardamom pods and the reserved lemon and orange seeds in a cheesecloth bag tied securely with kitchen twine.  While the fruit is cooking prepare the preserving jars and bring water to a boil in a water bath canner. Sterilize the jars and lids.  Add the sugar to the fruit mixture and stir until dissolved. Add the cheesecloth bag of cardamom and seeds. Continue to cook the marmalade at a steady boil until it reaches the gel stage or reaches 220&deg;F on a candy thermometer 30 to 40 minutes longer.  Remove the cheesecloth bag from the marmalade pressing any liquids back into the pan.  Remove the marmalade from the heat. Using a wide-mouth funnel and filling one jar at a time ladle the marmalade into hot sterilized jars leaving  1/2 inch headspace. Remove any air bubbles by running a long wooden utensil such as a chopstick or wooden skewer between the jar and the marmalade. Wipe the rims clean. Seal according to the manufacturer's directions. Process the jars in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and then turn off the heat. Wait 5 minutes and then lift the canning rack and using a canning jar lifter transfer the jars to a towel-lined sturdy rimmed baking sheet and let them rest. Check the seals wipe the jars and label. Note: Here's an easy way to check whether the marmalade is set. Put a small plate in the freezer. When the marmalade looks thickish and a bit gelled put a small amount of the marmalade on the frozen plate and return it to the freezer. After a couple of minutes run your finger or a spoon down the center and see if it stays separated and is a bit wrinkled. If so it is done.  Storing: Store the jars in a cool dark place for up to 1 year.

Pumpkin Bourbon Cakelets with Spiced Maple Glaze,Rebecca Firth of DisplacedHousewife ;www.displacedhousewife.com&lt;/i&gt;,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Pumpkin Bourbon Cakelets with Spiced Maple Glaze,1 serving,  For the Cakes: 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter room temperature  1/2 cup granulated sugar  3/4 cup brown sugar  1/2 cup pumpkin puree (not pie filling; 100% pumpkin)  1 large eggs room temperature 3 tablespoons bourbon 1 tablespoon water 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon cinnamon  1/2 teaspoon baking powder  1/2 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 teaspoon sea salt  3/4 teaspoon nutmeg  3/4 teaspoon ginger  3/4 teaspoon cloves  For the Glaze: 2 cups powdered sugar 3 tablespoons real maple syrup  3/4 teaspoon cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon nutmeg 2 tablespoons milk/cream or more to thin to desired consistency   , Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and grease the mini Bundt&#174; pan.  Place the butter granulated sugar and brown sugar in an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium until creamy and well blended about 3 to 4 minutes. Add in the pumpkin and mix for 1 minute more. With the mixer on low add the eggs one at a time mixing completely before adding in the next. Add the bourbon and water and run the mixer on low for 1 minute more.  In a medium bowl whisk together the flour cinnamon baking powder baking soda sea salt nutmeg ginger and cloves. Pour into the stand mixer and mix on low until barely combined and you still see streaks of flour. Take the bowl out of the mixer and gently fold the batter several more times until you see no more streaks. Distribute the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Tap on the counter several times to release any trapped bubbles.  Bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Lightly press the cakes to see if they're done…if they spring back they are done. If it leaves a bit of an indent they need a bit more time in the oven. Let cool for 30 minutes in the pan and gently turn out onto a cooling rack. If they resist coming out let cool a bit more in the pan. Cool completely before glazing.   In a small bowl whisk together the powdered sugar maple syrup cinnamon nutmeg and milk until smooth and drizzle over the tops of the cakelets. You want the glaze thin enough to drizzle and thick enough that it won’t run off the cakes.  I garnished with a fall flower from my garden…but I think a sprig of evergreen would also look beautiful!

Chard Mushroom and Swiss Cheese Frittata,Knives Cooks Love:Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Sarah Jay photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/breakfast/egg-dishes/Chard Mushroom and Swiss Cheese Frittata,6 servings,  1 pound Swiss chard  3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 8 ounces white mushrooms thinly sliced  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt plus extra for sprinkling  3/4 cup minced shallots 8 large eggs  3/4 cup half-and-half 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard Freshly ground black pepper 1  2/3 cups (5 ounces) grated Gruyere or Jarlsburg cheese  , The secret ingredient here is Dijon mustard. You won't taste it but it's working behind the scenes to deepen the flavor. Chop the chard with your longest chef's knife for efficiency-a 10-incher is perfect.  Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.  Trim the stems from the chard leaves. Discard the stems. Immerse the leaves in water to rid them of grit. Lift them out and drain. Chop the leaves coarsely.  Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a 10-inch ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms sprinkle lightly with salt and saute  stirring frequently until golden brown 5 to 7 minutes. Lower the heat to medium add the shallots and cook until the shallots are softened but not browned about 30 seconds. Add the chard a few handfuls at a time and cook tossing with tongs until soft and wilted about 4 minutes. Add  3/4 teaspoon of the salt and continue cooking and tossing until all the liquid in the pan evaporates about 3 more minutes. Turn off the heat.  Whisk the eggs half-and-half mustard the remaining  1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper together in a medium bowl. Stir in the cheese. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet and heat over medium heat. Spread out the vegetables evenly and when the pan is hot pour in the egg mixture. Cook until the bottom is set about 3 minutes and then transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake until the eggs are set on top about 15 minutes.  Place the frittata under the broiler a few inches from the heat source until the top is golden 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let rest for a few minutes; the frittata will pull away from the sides of the pan. Slice in the pan or else flip the frittata onto a plate and serve.

Pureed strawberries rose wine and simple syrup are placed in 12.2 oz Le Parfait jars and frozen until slushy. A splash of Grand Mariner tops this chilled beverage for a sweet citrus note.  Fill a Le Parfait 12.2 ounce jar with the rose strawberry puree and simple syrup (see instructions for making both below). Seal tightly with the lid. Shake and place in the freezer.  Every 45 minutes shake the mixture until a slush like consistency develops (about 3 to 4 hours).  Before serving top with a splash (or two) of Grand Marnier. Serve with a straw.  To make the Strawberry Puree: With a knife cut the strawberries in half. Place both ingredients into a food processor and puree until the fruit is a smooth soup-like consistency.

Fish Friture,Jacques Pepin,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Fish Friture, 8  Learn more about Scraps ,  1 pound small minnows whitebait smelt small sunfish or other tiny fish About 6 cups corn oil for deep-frying  1/2 cup milk 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder Salt   , A friture is a dish of deep-fried tiny fish: whitebait or other fish found in rivers or ponds are coated with flour and fried until crisp like French fries. Small freshwater minnows roach gudgeon and even very small sunfish are delectable prepared this way. I drag a net in knee-deep water along my local beach in late summer and get more of these fish than I could ever use. If you try this make sure you drag your net when the tide is coming in.  Friture is commonly served in small cafes along the little lakes and rivers in France often with aperitifs before a meal. Although some cooks fry the fish without gutting them they tend to taste bitter and the final result is well worth the work required to clean them. These tiny fish are utterly delicious and completely free an undiscovered resource.  Freshly caught fish will live for a while in a pail of water but most of the time I gut them right at the beach so I don't make a mess at home.   Prepare the fish: Using your thumb and index finger press and push down on the belly of each one starting at the head and pushing toward the tail so the guts come out. Wash the fish in cold water changing the water several times. Drain on paper towels then place in the milk to soak.  Heat the oil to about 400 degrees F. Meanwhile drain the fish and put it in a plastic bag with the flour and baking powder. Seal the bag and shake it so the fish are well coated with the mixture. (Be sure to do this at the last moment; you cannot keep the fish floured too long or the moisture in them will come out and make their outsides gummy.) Shake the fish in a colander to remove excess flour. Cook in batches dropping the fish into the hot oil and cooking for about 5 minutes until crisp and brown. Lift out of the oil and sprinkle with salt.  Arrange the fish on a platter and serve. Eat piping hot with your fingers. 
Orange Dinner Rolls,Natalie Dicks,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Orange Dinner Rolls,18 rolls,  For the dough:  3/4-cup whole milk warm (about  110 degrees F)   3/4-cup granulated sugar 1 egg + 1 egg yolk room temperature and lightly beaten  1 tbsp. instant yeast  3 2/3-cup all-purpose flour  1 3/4 tsp. coarse kosher sea salt  8 tbsp. (1 stick) butter room temperature   For the filling:  4 tbsp. ( 1/2 stick) butter softened  2 tbsp. granulated sugar  Zest of 3 medium oranges   3/4 tsp. orange extract or  1/2 tsp. orange blossom water (optional)   For the glaze: 2 tbsp. melted butter  2 tbsp. orange juice   , When we got married my husband and I did our best to blend some of our family's traditions together for the holidays. Naturally food was where we started.   My mom always made the best rolls. I can remember on a few occasions she made orange dinner rolls. They were heavenly! Warm buttery and bursting with fresh orange zest.   We make a modified version for our Thanksgiving spread. They're one of my favorite ways to use up the oranges we receive from my husband's citrus growing family in Florida. We always get a box or two around the holidays and they always get put to good use!  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment add milk sugar egg and egg yolk. Sprinkle the yeast over top and allow it to sit until foamy about 5 - 7 minutes.   Add flour and salt mix until combined about 2 minutes. Switch to the dough hook and knead on low for 1 minute. Add 8 tablespoons of softened butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until the dough forms a soft sticky ball about 5-6 minutes.   Place the dough in a large well-greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled about 1 - 1 1/2 hours (if you live in a warm humid climate you can do this at room temperature however if your kitchen is cool you may want to let your oven heat to 100 degrees F turn it off and let it rise in there).   Punch dough to deflate and then place onto a floured surface. Roll the dough into a large 16-inch circle.   In a medium bowl combine the soft butter sugar orange zest and extract or water if using. Mix until smooth and creamy. Using a pastry brush or an offset spatula spread over the surface of the circle of dough.   Using a pizza wheel or pastry wheel cut 18 triangles or wedges. Roll each into a crescent shape starting at the outer edge and rolling inward towards the tip.   Place onto a well-greased baking sheet with the tip tucked under (if it's not under good enough it may unroll as it rises). Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 40 minutes to 1 hour or until doubled in size (again you may want to do this in the oven if your kitchen is cool).   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.   When the rolls have risen remove plastic wrap and place in the oven to bake for 18 - 22 minutes or until golden brown on the tops. Remove from the oven and brush with the melted butter and orange juice. Remove from the pan and serve while warm.

Pommes Dauphinoise,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Pommes Dauphinoise,4 to 6 servings,   1/2 cup whole milk 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream 1 bay leaf  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 tablespoons unsalted butter plus more for buttering the baking dish 1 medium leek white part only halved lengthwise and cut crosswise into  3/4-inch thick slices 1 medium garlic clove minced 1 teaspoon minced thyme leaves 2 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes peeled and sliced about  1/8-inch thick Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup grated Gruyere cheese   , This dish is a specialty of the Dauphine region of France. A mandoline makes quick work of thinly slicing the potatoes. Make sure to not rinse the potatoes after they have been sliced as the starch in the potatoes help thicken the sauce.  Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F.  In a small saucepan combine the milk cream bay leaf and nutmeg and place on the stove over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to infuse the cream.   Place a medium skillet on the stove over medium heat.

Golden Beet and Blood Orange Salad,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/salads/fruit-vegetable/Golden Beet and Blood Orange Salad,4 servings,  4 medium golden beets  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon Champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 large or 3 small blood oranges  3/4 small red onion very thinly sliced or shaved on a vegetable slicer 1 heaping tablespoon thinly sliced fresh mint  , Put this vivid salad on a buffet and heads will turn. Slices of beet the color of a summer sunset alternate with ruby slices of blood orange a pairing to turn to when you're serving grilled swordfish ham or pork tenderloin. The salad is just as refreshing if not quite as surprising made with red beets and navel oranges.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. If the beet greens are attached remove all but  1/2" of the stem. Reserve the greens and stems for another use (page 31). Put the beets in a baking dish and add water to a depth of  3/4". Cover tightly and bake until a knife pierces the beets easily 45 to 55 minutes. When cool enough to handle peel the beets and slice into thin rounds.  To make the vinaigrette in a small bowl whisk together the olive oil vinegar and salt and pepper to taste.  Cut a slice off the top and bottom of each orange. Working with 1 orange at a time set the fruit on a cutting board one cut side down. Using a chef's knife slice away the peel from top to bottom following the contour of the fruit and removing all the white pith. Slice the orange thinly crosswise. Repeat with the remaining orange(s).  To assemble the salad alternate slices of beet and orange on a platter. Scatter the onion evenly over all. Whisk the dressing briefly and spoon it over the salad. Sprinkle with the mint and serve immediately.

In batches stir in greens covering pan to wilt between each addition.  Add nutmeg and clementine juice. Season more with salt and pepper before serving.  Tips:  Crush your ginger with the side of a knife before mincing. Keep the stems on your beet greens! They add a little crunch to the sauteed greens.  1/2 teaspoon nutmeg is about 10 gratings on a fine rasp grater. Most recipes call for naval oranges. You never end up using the entire orange. Use clementines instead-you probably already have them in your fridge.   
Buttermilk Salad Dressing with Dried Tomatoes,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/salads/dressings-vinaigrettes/Buttermilk Salad Dressing with Dried Tomatoes,about 1 1/3 cups,   1/2 ounce dried tomatoes (about 6 tomato halves) homemade or store-bought preferably without sulfur  1/2 cup boiling water  1/2 cup mayonnaise  1/2 cup buttermilk 2 green onions white and pale green parts only minced 2 teaspoons minced fresh dill 1 small clove garlic minced to a paste  1/2 to 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper  , Dried tomatoes so intense on their own can play a background role in a salad dressing. In this creamy ranch-style blend they contribute sweetness body and an appetizing blush. They are hardly discernible but the dressing would be less compelling without them. Spoon it over hearts of romaine heirloom tomatoes beets or an old-fashioned iceberg wedge. It also makes a tasty dip for crudités.  Put the tomatoes in a small heatproof bowl add the boiling water and let stand until softened 10 minutes or more. Drain in a sieve and squeeze to remove excess moisture. Chop finely.  In a bowl whisk together the mayonnaise and buttermilk then whisk in the green onions dill garlic and 2 tablespoons chopped tomato. (If you have a little extra tomato mix with some extra virgin olive oil and spread on a baguette slice.) Add the vinegar to taste then season with salt and pepper. If you used store-bought mayonnaise you may not need additional salt. Use the dressing immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.   
Pommes Anna,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Pommes Anna,6 servings,  8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter 3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes sliced into  1/8" rounds Sea salt Freshly ground black pepper  3/4 cup fresh thyme leaves picked and lightly chopped  , Preheat oven to 350 degrees   To a small saucepan set over medium-high heat add butter. Once butter is fully melted continue to heat until butter comes to a gentle boil and white foam begins to float to the surface. Reduce heat to medium and gently boil until the white foam sinks to the bottom of the pan and the boiling will calm down. Once boiling has stopped pour butter through a cheesecloth-lined strainer.  To a heavy oven-safe 8-10" inch skillet set over medium-low heat add 2 tablespoons of the clarified butter. Quickly arrange potato slices in concentric circles overlapping potato slices slightly in bottom of the pan. Brush first layer with clarified butter and season with salt pepper and thyme. Repeat with remaining potatoes buttering and seasoning between layers. Pour remaining butter over top of potatoes.  Continue cooking potatoes on the stovetop until you see the potatoes around the edge of the pan begin to brown. Remove from heat top with a piece of parchment paper and set in an oven-safe skillet or pan about the same diameter of the skillet with the potatoes on top of the parchment paper and press down firmly.  Transfer pans to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a thin knife inserted into the middle of the potatoes gives no resistance.  Unmolding and serving: When potatoes are done place cover slightly askew on pan and drain out excess butter which may be used again in other cooking. Run spatula around edge of pan. Shake pan and if potatoes have stuck to bottom run spatula carefully under potatoes to loosen them but disturb them as little as possible. Invert a large flat plate over the potato pan reverse the two and potatoes will drop onto dish.   Serve warm or at room temperature.

Dark Chocolate Pecan Pie,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Dark Chocolate Pecan Pie,1 (9-inch) pie, Pie Filling  6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup granulated sugar  3/4 cup light corn syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon rum  1/2 teaspoon salt 3 large eggs  1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate roughly chopped 2 cups pecans whole or halved  Pastry Dough 1- 3/4 cups all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  1/2 cup unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes   , The key to this luscious pie is achieved by placing a layer of chocolate on the bottom of the crust followed by layers of pecans on top before adding the filling mixture. During the cooking process the pecans gently float to the surface and disperse beautifully throughout the pie.   MAKE THE DOUGH: Either place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl or into a bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. If using a mixing bowl use a pastry blender two knives or your fingers to cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring.  If using a food processor add the cut butter to the flour and pulse mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Drizzle in ice water and pulse until the flour holds together.   Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.  While the dough is chilling heat an oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the lower-third of the oven.  PREPARE THE PIE SHELL: Lightly grease a 9-inch pie plate that is at least 2-inches deep. This will make serving the pie easier after it is baked.  Roll-out the pastry for the pie to a 13-inch circle. Transfer it to the prepared pan and trim the edges so they overlap the edge by an inch all the way around. Tuck the edges up and under and flute them. Put the lined pie pan in the refrigerator to chill for 10 minutes.  Line the crust with foil and fill it with pie weights. Blind bake the crust for 10 minutes. Remove it from the oven gently remove foil with weights and set the crust aside to cool while you prepare the filling.   MAKE THE FILLING: Place the butter in a medium saucepan and melt on the stove over a moderate heat. When melted add the sugar and stir until smooth about 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and whisk in the corn syrup vanilla rum and salt. In a separate bowl add the eggs and whisk lightly then whisk in the corn syrup mixture.   ASSEMBLE AND BAKE THE PIE: Place the partially baked crust onto a rimmed baking sheet. Scatter the chocolate evenly over the bottom of the crust and arrange all the pecans on top of the chocolate. Pour the corn syrup mixture over the pecans and transfer the baking sheet into the oven to bake until the filling is set about 50 minutes to 1 hour.  Allow to cool completely before serving.   
Sous Vide Carnitas Tacos,Sansaire,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Sous Vide Carnitas Tacos,1 serving,  Pork shoulder cut into 2-inch cubes Seasoning of your choice   , Sous vide is ridiculously useful for barbecue and grilling situations. Because different meats take different times to cook and because nobody wants to under- or overcook their meats we always cook everything until done sous vide then slap it on a hot grill just to finish. The results are phenomenal. You get the same romanticism of traditional grilling but with vastly better results. Plus since all your food is cooked ahead of time and hanging out in a warm bath when people get hungry it only takes a few minutes to feed the crowd.  Coat pork shoulder liberally with your favorite rub (ex. brown sugar paprika black pepper kosher salt smoked chipotle tabasco sauce cocoa powder).   Vacuum seal-important to use a sealer not zip-top bags for this one because of the long cooking time.   Cook sous vide at 149 degrees F for 36 hours.   Run bag(s) under cool water until they're cool enough to handle then shred pork by smooshing it with your fingers still in the bag. It will shred easily.   No searing necessary but if desired add quick char in a rocket-hot cast iron skillet. Put on tacos with your favorite toppings.  Note: You can substitute chicken thighs and keep the temperature the same. Cook for 2 hours up to 12 hours. In this case you can use a zip-top bag. This is one of the recipes we've done for the SLT cooking classes. 
Roast Leg of Lamb with Fennel Seeds and Rosemary Crust,Knives Cooks Love:Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Sarah Jay photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Roast Leg of Lamb with Fennel Seeds and Rosemary Crust,8 to 10 servings,  2 cups fresh coarse bread crumbs 1&frasl;2 cup plus 2 tablespoons pine nuts 3 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary 4 anchovy fillets 3 medium cloves garlic 2 teaspoons fennel seeds crushed in a mortar or with a mallet 1&frasl;2 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 6 pound bone-in leg of lamb (aitchbone removed) shank bone on   , This is a delicious excuse to learn to carve bone-in leg of lamb.

Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a large heavy-duty roasting pan set over medium heat. Sear the lamb on all sides until deeply browned 3 to 4 minutes per side. (You'll need to prop up and support the leg with tongs to sear some areas.)  Set the leg in the pan with the flatter side down. Spread the bread crumb mixture evenly on top of the leg and partially down the sides. Roast until medium rare 70 to 80 minutes when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest section of meat (without touching the bone) should read 130&deg;F. Let the meat rest for at least 20 minutes before carving.

Pork Tenderloin Medallions with Orange-Rosemary Balsamic Butter,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Pork Tenderloin Medallions with Orange-Rosemary Balsamic Butter,2 servings,  1 (14 to 16-ounce) pork tenderloin Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 10 ounces spinach large stems removed washed well with water still clinging to leaves  1/2 cup orange-rosemary balsamic butter sauce (recipe follows)   Orange-Rosemary Balsamic Butter Sauce: Yields about  1/2 cup.    3/4 cup balsamic vinegar  3/4 cup fresh orange juice 1 teaspoon minced shallot or yellow onion 1 fresh rosemary sprig 4 inches long 4 to 5 tablespoons very cold unsalted butter in one large piece plus 1 tablespoon if needed Kosher salt   , Pork tenderloin is one of the easiest meats to prepare and cook and its sweet flavor and tender texture are appreciated by nearly all meat eaters. Choose good-quality natural pork not one that's been "enhanced" with a flavored brine-I hate the flavor and texture of those. In this dish I like the contrast of the slightly earthy tannic greens with the mild meat and fruity-tangy herbal sauce. You could make this same dish with turkey cutlets in place of the pork or with Swiss chard instead of spinach. If you opt for the chard allow a bit more time for it to cook.  With a very sharp knife trim away any patches of silver skin and big pieces of fat from the tenderloin. Cut into 1-inch thick slices. Flatten each slice lightly with the heel of your hand. Season both sides of each slice generously with salt and pepper.  Heat a large frying pan over medium-high add 1 tablespoon of oil and then add the pork. The pork should sizzle as soon as it touches the pan. If it doesn't wait another minute to let the pan get properly hot. If all of the pork will not fit in a single layer without crowding use two pans or cook it in batches. Saute the pork until nicely browned on the first side 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and finish cooking until browned on the second side and still pink in the center another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate tent with aluminum foil and let rest while you cook the spinach.  If there's a lot of fat in the pan pour it off but don't rinse the pan. Drop the spinach into the pan and quickly toss it around until it wilts. Season with a bit of salt and pepper and keep cooking until it's tender and most of the liquid has evaporated 30 seconds to 1 minute. Some spinach gives off a lot of water so if it's getting tender but is still quite wet just pour out the excess water from the pan pressing on the spinach with tongs or a spoon to release even more. Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Arrange a nice pile of wilted spinach on each warmed plate and top with the pork medallions. Pour any accumulated pork juices over the pork and spinach then drizzle a thick ribbon of the butter sauce (recipe below) around the base of the spinach reserving a little of the sauce to pass at the table. Serve right away.  Orange-Rosemary Balsamic Butter Sauce : In a small saucepan combine the vinegar orange juice shallot and rosemary and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook stirring and scraping the sides of the pan occasionally with a silicone spatula until the liquid is reduced to 3 tablespoons about 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the butter and start stirring it around in circles with a whisk a fork a wooden spoon or anything that lets you "stab" the hunk of butter so that you can move it around easily. The butter will start to melt and the mixture will bubble and boil around the edges. The melted butter should look creamy rather than melted and oily. Keep stirring and blending until almost all of the butter is incorporated then remove the pan from the heat as you work in the last bit.  Remove and discard the rosemary sprig (squeegee the sauce off it with your fingers so you don't lose a drop) and whisk in  3/4 teaspoon salt. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt if needed. If the sauce is still very sharp whisk in another  1/2 tablespoon cold butter.   For a perfectly smooth sauce strain it through a fine-mesh sieve. If you are okay with the shallot serve as is. Sauce is best served fresh.

Rub the steak liberally with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Allow steak to sit at room temperature for about thirty minutes before cooking.  To prepare the garlic-rosemary oil: Combine remaining  2/3-cup olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan and place over low heat. Cook until garlic starts to turn brown around the edges about 5 minutes. Add chopped rosemary and freshly ground black pepper stirring to combine.  To fry the capers: Fill a small saucepan with a  1/2-inch of vegetable oil and heat over medium heat until the oil registers 325 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Using a slotted spoon carefully add capers to hot oil and fry stirring once until they begin to open and turn golden brown 1 to 2 minutes. Remove fried capers with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.   Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Place the steak on the grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs turn the steak and cook to medium-rare or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the steak registers 130 degrees F about 5 minutes more. (For steaks thicker than 1 1/2 inches transfer steak to a rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and roast in a preheated 400 degrees F oven to finish cooking.) Transfer steak to a cutting board and allow it to rest for 5 minutes.  To serve: Arrange arugula over a large serving platter or plates. Using a carving knife cut the steak across the grain into  3/4-inch thick slices and arrange over the greens. Drizzle some of the warm garlic-rosemary oil and aged balsamic over (reserve the rest of the garlic oil for other uses). Scatter the fried capers and shaved parmesan over the top. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.

Strawberry-Vanilla Preserves,Allison Carroll Duffy Preserving with Pomona's Pectin,home/recipes/breakfast/jams-preserves/Strawberry-Vanilla Preserves,4 to 5 (8-ounce) jars,  2 3/4 pounds strawberries  1/2 cup water 1 vanilla bean 1 1/2 teaspoons calcium water 1 3/4 cups sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons Pomona's Pectin powder </ul  , With ripe in-season strawberries combined with a smooth exotic note of fresh vanilla this preserve is nothing short of heavenly. It will add a bit of flair to the breakfast table (or bagel) of course but it's also great in desserts&#8212try it on top of a biscuit with a bit of whipped cream for a spectacular strawberry-vanilla shortcake! The berries in this preserve tend to float to the top during canning so mix it up well before serving.  Before you begin: Prepare calcium water.  To do this combine  1/2 teaspoon calcium powder (in the small packet in your box of Pomona's pectin) with  1/2 cup water in a small clear jar with a lid. Shake well.  Extra calcium water may be stored in the refrigerator for future use.  Wash your jars lids and bands. Place jars in canner fill canner  2/3 full with water bring canner to a rolling boil and boil jars for 10 minutes to sterilize them. (Add 1 extra minute of sterilizing time for every 1000 feet above sea level.) Reduce heat and allow jars to remain in hot canner water until ready to use. Place lids in water in a small sauce pan heat to a low simmer and hold until ready to use. Rinse strawberries and remove stems.  Combine strawberries and the  1/2 cup of water in a large saucepan. Using a paring knife slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Add the vanilla seeds and the bean pod itself to the strawberries. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat reduce heat and simmer covered for 3 to 4 minutes stirring occasionally. Stir carefully- you don't want to crush the berries. Remove from heat.  Measure 4 cups of the cooked strawberry mixture (saving any extra for another use) and return the measured quantity to the saucepan. Add calcium water and mix well.  In a separate bowl combine sugar and pectin powder. Mix thoroughly and set aside.  Bring strawberry mixture back to a full boil over high heat. Slowly add pectin-sugar mixture stirring constantly. Continue to stir vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes to dissolve pectin while the preserves come back up to a boil. Once the preserves return to a full boil remove the pan from the heat. Using tongs carefully remove the vanilla bean pod from the preserves and discard.  Can Your Preserves: Remove jars from canner and ladle hot preserves into hot jars leaving  3/4 inch of headspace. Remove trapped air bubbles wipe rims with a damp cloth put on lids and screw bands and tighten to fingertip tight. Lower filled jars into canner ensuring jars are not touching each other and are covered with at least 1 to 2 inches of water. Place lid on canner return to a rolling boil and process for 10 minutes (adjusting for altitude if necessary). Turn off heat and allow canner to sit untouched for 5 minutes then remove jars and allow to cool undisturbed for 12 to 24 hours. Confirm that jars have sealed then store properly. Eat within 1 year. Lasts 3 weeks once opened.  Tip: Unlike jams which usually require that you mash the fruit when you're making preserves the idea is to keep individual pieces of fruit (or uniformly cut pieces of fruit) mostly whole and intact. For strawberries small or average-size berries are ideal though larger berries will work – simply slice them in half if they are too big. To help avoid mashing delicate fruit unintentionally use a wider saucepan so that fruit has room to spread out and cook evenly without a lot of stirring. And when you do stir stir with a back-and-forth motion rather than an up-and-down motion-this way you'll be less likely to crush the berries.   
Black Eyed Peas with Collard Greens,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Black Eyed Peas with Collard Greens,4 to 6 servings,   1/2 pound smoked ham hocks or smoked turkey wings 1 tablespoon sea salt 1 tablespoon hot sauce plus more for serving 4 garlic cloves thinly sliced 1 large onion roughly chopped 1 bunch (1 1/2 pounds) collard greens 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 cups cooked black-eyed peas (16-ounce can) drained and rinsed  Freshly ground black pepper   , In a Dutch oven bring 3 quarts of water to a boil and add smoked meat salt and hot sauce garlic and onion.  Reduce heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes.  Wash the collard greens thoroughly.  Remove the stems that run down the center by holding the leaf in one hand and stripping the leaf down with your other hand.  The tender young leaves in the heart of the collards do not need to be stripped. Stack 6 to 8 leaves on top of one another roll up and slice into  1/2- to 1-inch thick slices.   Place greens in Dutch oven with the meat and add butter and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes or until greens are tender stirring occasionally.  When greens are tender remove the ham hock from the stock and set aside to cool.  Fold in the black eyed peas into the collards and simmer until warmed through about 10 minutes.  Remove as much meat as you can from the ham hocks and shred the ham. Fold the ham back into the collards and taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

Peanut Butter and Chocolate Marble Brownies,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Peanut Butter and Chocolate Marble Brownies,12 large brownies,  5 ounces semisweet chocolate (up to 56 percent cacao) finely chopped 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter softened (65&deg; to 68&deg;F) 2 cups (16 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar  3/4 cup (6 3/4 ounces) creamy salted peanut butter at room temperature 3 large eggs at room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 3/4 cups (6 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder  1/2 teaspoon salt  1/2 cup (2 3/4 ounces) unsalted peanuts chopped   , Chewy and boldly flavored these brownies walk a thin line between sweet and salty which is part of what makes them so addictive&#45;eating them is like trying to have just one potato chip. This recipe needs a moderately sweet chocolate for the best texture as the chocolates with higher percentages of cacao make the batter too dry and bitter. Save those for a recipe in which their intense flavor can shine.  Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Line a 9 by13-inch baking pan with parchment paper or foil across the bottom and up two long sides then lightly coat with melted butter oil or high-heat canola-oil spray.  Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in the bottom of the double boiler. Place the chopped chocolate in the top of the double boiler (off the heat). Turn off the heat then set the chocolate over the steaming water. While you are preparing the rest of the recipe occasionally stir the chocolate with the spatula until it is smooth and melted. Let it sit over the warm water until needed.  In the bowl of the stand mixer cream the butter and brown sugar on medium-high speed for 5 minutes or until much lighter in color (the mixture will look clumpy and sandy even when fully creamed). You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl although you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with the cleaned spatula. Add the peanut butter and beat well on medium-high for 30 seconds. Scrape down the bowl again. Crack the eggs into the small bowl and beat with a fork to blend. With the mixer running on medium add the eggs about a tablespoon at a time incorporating each addition fully before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla. Scrape down the bowl.  In the medium bowl whisk together the flour baking powder and salt. Add to the peanut butter mixture all at once then blend on the lowest speed just until you no longer see any streaks of flour and the batter is smooth. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure that any patches of flour or butter are blended into the batter.  Stir half of the batter into the melted chocolate (it may look slightly grainy but this is fine). Stir the chopped peanuts into the remaining half of the batter.  Use a small offset spatula to spread a little more than half of the plain peanut batter in the bottom of the prepared pan. This layer will be very thin and it will seem like there is not enough batter but it will be fine. Top with all of the chocolate batter spreading it into an even layer (this is easiest to do by dropping big dollops of batter around the pan then merging them with the spatula). Drop the remaining peanut batter by the level tablespoon in 3 evenly spaced rows of 5 dollops each. If you have any batter left drop it in wherever you like. Drag a toothpick or the tip of a paring knife through each dollop a couple of times swirling it into the chocolate batter around it. The batter will look very rough and ragged&#45;don't worry it will smooth out as it bakes and the slightly rugged look that remains is very appealing.  Bake the brownies for 30 to 40 minutes until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Transfer to a rack to cool for 15 to 20 minutes. To remove the brownies from the pan run a thin knife or flexible spatula around the two short edges to loosen them from the pan. Grasp the parchment paper along the two long edges and pull gently upward. Set the brownies on a cutting surface and cut as desired. Serve warm.  Storing: The brownies will keep wrapped tightly in plastic at room temperature for 2 to 3 days or in the refrigerator for 4 or 5 days. These brownies are at their best when warm. Reheat them for 15 to 20 seconds in the microwave to restore their chewiness and bring out their flavors.  <br

Ever notice how spices clump up and don't blend well when added to a custard? The trick is to blend them first with the eggs whose fat helps the clumps disperse evenly before adding any liquid to the custard mixture. 	 b>To prepare the pie crust: remove the dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll chilled dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until the circle measures 14 inches wide and  1/8 inch thick. Starting at one edge roll the dough around the rolling pin and lay it gently on top of a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie pan. Gently press the dough into the bottom and sides of the pan. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough so it overhangs the edge of the pan by 1 inch. Fold the overhanging dough under itself around the pan edge then crimp or form a decorative border. Chill the lined pan for at least 30 minutes.   Preheat oven to 375&#176F and place a rack in the bottom third.   Prepare the pie for blind baking: line the chilled pie shell with heavy-duty foil pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 20 to 22 minutes until the foil comes away from the dough easily (if it doesn't then bake another 5 to 6 minutes and check again). Remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and lift out the foil and weights from the shell; set them aside to cool. Return the pan to the oven to continue baking the shell for about 10 minutes then remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and check to see if any cracks have formed. If you see a crack very gently smear a tiny bit of reserved dough over the crack to patch it-you need only enough to seal the opening. Return the pan to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer until the crust is a nice golden brown all over. Transfer to a rack and cool slightly. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees.  While the pie crust is baking make the filling: whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl to break them up. Add cinnamon ginger nutmeg cloves allspice and salt and whisk well to blend evenly. Whisk in the cream brown sugar granulated sugar and pumpkin and blend well. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer directly into the tart shell and bake until the custard is set about 30 to 40 minutes. Test by tapping the side of the pie pan-the center of the pie should look firm and move as one piece. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool completely about 2 hours.  Make the meringue: bring an inch of water to a boil in the bottom of the double boiler. Place the egg whites and sugar in the top of the double boiler off the heat. Set on top of the simmering water and whisk constantly (not vigorously just enough to keep the whites moving) for 4 to 5 minutes until the egg whites are hot to the touch and the mixture reaches 160-degrees on an instant read thermometer (the mixture should look frothy but not whipped). Remove the whites from the heat each time you test their temperature. When they are on the heat keep whisking to prevent scrambling. If that happens there is no recourse and you will have to begin again so watc

Grand Marnier Truffles,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/confections/Grand Marnier Truffles,24 (1-inch round) truffles,  1 pound semisweet chocolate  3/4 cup (6 ounces) heavy cream  3/4cup (2 ounces) light corn syrup Zest of 2 oranges 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter room temperature  3/4cup (2 ounces) Grand Marnier or other orange-flavored liqueur  1/2 teaspoon pure orange oil 1 pound bittersweet chocolate melted and cooled   , To prepare ganache place semisweet chocolate in a large heatproof mixing bowl. Set aside. Combine heavy cream corn syrup and orange zest in a medium saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until mixture boils. Immediately pour mixture through a fine-mesh strainer over chocolate. Stir chocolate mixture with a silicone spatula until thoroughly combined and shiny. Stir in butter Grand Marnier and orange oil. Pour mixture into a shallow baking dish or a small rimmed baking sheet and chill overnight.  Use a melon ball scoop warmed briefly in hot water to scoop balls of ganache. Take care to thoroughly wipe off all excess water from the scoop to avoid adding water to the ganache. Quickly roll ganache between your palms to form the truffles into a ball. Place a small amount of melted bittersweet chocolate in the center of your palm and roll truffle to coat. Roll the coated truffle onto a parchment-lined sheet tray. Once the chocolate sets coat the truffles a second time. Repeat process with remaining truffles.   These rich bites get a double dose of chocolate from semisweet and bittersweet varieties. Make the ganache for the centers of the truffles the day before to allow the mixture to chill and set properly. Finished truffles can be stored in the refrigerator in  a tightly sealed container for 1 to 2 days.

Grilled Pizza with Mozzarella Arugula and Chile Oil,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/main-courses/pizza/Grilled Pizza with Mozzarella Arugula and Chile Oil,2 to 4 servings,  Dough:  3/4 cup warm (105&deg;F to 115&deg;F) water 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 tablespoon olive oil plus more for the bowl 1 teaspoon Kosher or sea salt About 1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  Chile Oil: 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 large clove garlic finely minced  3/4 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes Pinch of kosher or sea salt  1/2 teaspoon dried oregano  Other ingredients: Cornmeal for dusting the pizza peel  1/2 pound low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella cheese grated on the large holes of a box grater Large handful of baby arugula   , Wispy leaves of young arugula are used like an herb in this recipe sprinkled on the sizzling pizza just as it comes off the grill. Note the long slow rise on the dough-a total of six hours-which produces a particularly light chewy and flavorful crust.  To make the dough put the warm water in a bowl and sprinkle the surface with the yeast. Let stand for 2 minutes to soften then whisk with a fork to blend. Let stand until bubbly about 10 minutes. Whisk in the olive oil and salt then begin adding 1 1/2 cups of the flour gradually beating with a wooden spoon until fully incorporated. The dough will be very moist and sticky.  Turn the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and knead with floured hands until smooth and elastic about 5 minutes incorporating as much of the remaining  3/4 cup flour as needed to keep the dough from clinging to your hands or the work surface. The dough will remain moist and a little tacky but should not be sticky. Shape into a ball. Oil a bowl transfer the dough to it and turn the dough to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours.  Punch the dough down. Reshape into a ball re-cover the bowl and let the dough rise again for 4 hours.  If using a charcoal grill prepare a moderate fire. When the coals are ready arrange them in an even layer on one-half of the grill bed.  If using a gas grill preheat all burners to high. About 15 minutes before grilling put a baking stone on the grill rack. The internal temperature of the grill should be 575 degrees F to 600 degrees F.  Punch the dough down turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface and shape into a ball. Dust the surface of the dough with flour cover with a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.  To make the chile oil in a small bowl whisk together the olive oil garlic hot pepper flakes and salt. Add the oregano crumbling it between your fingers as you do and whisk again. Let stand for 30 minutes to blend the flavors.  If you are using a round kettle grill with charcoal you will need to shape the dough into a rectangle so that you can cook the crust first directly over the bed of coals then flip it and finish cooking it over indirect heat. If you are using a gas grill with a baking stone you can shape the dough into a circle because you will not need to flip it.  Dust a pizza peel or rimless baking sheet generously with cornmeal. To prepare the dough for topping you can stretch it with a rolling pin or your hands. Lightly flour a work surface. To use a pin roll out the dough on the floured surface into a 13- to 14-inch circle or into a roughly 16- by 10-inch rectangle depending on your grill. Transfer to the prepared peel. To work by hand flatten the dough into a round then drape the round over the back of your two flour-dusted hands. Form your hands into fists and rotate the dough on your fists. The dough is supple enough that it will stretch with little effort on your part. Stretch into a 13- to 14-inch circle or into a roughly 16- by 10-inch rectangle depending on your grill. Transfer to the prepared pizza peel.  If you are grilling the pizza over charcoal slide the dough off onto the grill rack directly over the coals. Cook uncovered until the dough begins to puff and blister and the bottom becomes nicely browned or even lightly charred in spots 1 to 2 minutes. With tongs or your hands flip the dough over onto the half of the grill with no coals. Working quickly top with the cheese spreading it evenly but leaving a  3/4-inch rim uncovered. Brush the rim with the chile oil then drizzle more of the oil including the garlic and herbs over the pizza reserving a little oil for brushing the pizza rim after grilling. Cover the grill and cook until the pizza rim is well browned and the cheese is melted and bubbling about 5 minutes. Transfer t

Fig and Raspberry Tart with Honey,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen Image by Rosana Machiela,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Fig and Raspberry Tart with Honey,nch pie crust and 4 (4 1/2-inch) tarts,  Tart: All-purpose flour for dusting 1 recipe Pie Dough (recipe follows) 1 cup mascarpone cheese  3/4 cup heavy whipping cream  3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons orange juice 8 fresh figs stemmed and quartered lengthwise 1- 1/2 cups (8-ounces) fresh raspberries picked over and rinsed 2 tablespoons honey warmed  Pie Dough: 1  3/4 cups (6  3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons granulated sugar   1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch cubes 3 to 4 tablespoons ice water   , This colorful tart is bursting with fresh fruit flavors and is very simple to make. Prepare the tart shells and the cream filling ahead of time and assemble the tarts as you need them.  To make the dough: This recipe produces a simple lightly sweetened crust that can be used with all types of fillings. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month.  Place flour sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor or large mixing bowl. By pulsing or using a pastry blender cut the butter into the flour until the butter is the size of small peas.   Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Pulse or stir mixture until large clumps form. When enough water has been added to allow the dough to hold together transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Gather the dough together to form a ball. Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before using.    To make the tart: Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center of the oven.   b>To prepare the tart shell: Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and divide pie dough in four. Roll out each piece of pie dough into a circle with a 6-inch diameter. Fit dough circle into fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Bring the dough up the sides of the pan and trim any excess dough. Press dough gently into the flutes of the tin with the side of your finger to create a fluted edge. Repeat with remaining three pans. Transfer to the freezer until firm about 15 minutes.   To blind bake the tart shell: Line the chilled tart shell with heavy-duty foil pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 15 minutes until the foil comes away from the dough easily.  Remove the pan from the oven remove the foil and the pie weighs and prick the uncooked pastry base with a fork. Return pan to oven and continue baking the shell until the crust is golden-brown for about 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool.  To assemble the tart: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whip attachment beat the mascarpone cream and sugar until the mixture is smooth about 30 seconds. Stir in the orange juice and spread the mixture evenly across the bottom of the tart shells. Arrange the 8 fig quarters in each tart shell cut sides up fitting the figs tightly against the sides of the tart shell and each other. Arrange the raspberries in the center of the tart shell and drizzle the warmed honey all over the tart.  To serve: Remove the sides and bases of the tart pans and serve.

Roast Chicken with Bread and Arugula Salad by Ina Garten,Ina Garten Make it Ahead,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Roast Chicken with Bread and Arugula Salad by Ina Garten,4 servings, Roast Chicken   1 (4- to 4 1/2-pound) whole chicken preferably Bell & Evans 4 sprigs fresh thyme 2 large garlic cloves smashed flat 1 lemon quartered 2 teaspoons fine sea salt plus extra for serving  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 to 4 ( 3/4-inch-thick) slices country bread Good olive oil    Arugula Salad     3/4 cup Champagne vinegar 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon minced garlic Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  1/2 cup good olive oil  1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions white and green parts (3 scallions)  2 tablespoons dried currants 6 cups baby arugula lightly packed (6 to 8 ounces)    Note: Baby arugula holds up better than traditional arugula under the warm chicken.  , This incredibly delicious roast chicken is inspired by Zuni Cafe in San Francisco. It's Ina's homage to the late Judy Rodgers' passion for rustic country food.  MAKE IT AHEAD:   Up to a day ahead season the chicken and clean the arugula.  Prepare the vinaigrette and refrigerate separately. Roast the chicken and assemble the salad before serving.  PREP AND BAKE THE CHICKEN:   Place the chicken in a baking dish. Using your fingers gently loosen the skin from the breasts and thighs without breaking the skin. Carefully slide the sprigs of thyme and the garlic under the skin. Put the lemon in the cavity. Tie the legs together and tuck the wings under the body. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of sea salt and the pepper cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. (Be sure your oven is very clean!) Place the bread in a medium (10-inch) cast-iron skillet in a single layer. Brush the chicken with olive oil and place it breast side up on top of the bread. Roast for 30 minutes turn it over and roast for 15 minutes until the juices run clear when you cut between the leg and the thigh. Wrap the skillet tightly with aluminum foil and allow the chicken to rest at room temperature for a full 30 minutes. (Don't worry; it will stay hot.) The bread will be almost burnt on the bottom and soft with the pan drippings on top.  MAKE THE VINAIGRETTE:   Whisk the vinegar mustard garlic 1 teaspoon salt and  1/2 teaspoon pepper together in a small bowl or glass measuring cup. Whisk in the olive oil stir in the scallions and currants and set aside. Place the arugula in a large bowl add the vinaigrette and toss well.  TO SERVE:   Place the Arugula Salad in a very large shallow serving platter. Put the chicken and the bread on a cutting board. Cut the bread into 1-inch squares and sprinkle them on the salad.  Carve the chicken thickly and place it on top of the salad. To carve cut off the legs and cut between the thigh and the leg. For the breasts cut the wings off remove each breast in one large piece and make thick slices crosswise. Spoon the pan juices over the chicken sprinkle it with sea salt and serve warm over the salad.

Turn the oven off transfer the turkey to an ovenproof platter and return it to the warm oven to rest. Set the roasting pan aside.  While the turkey is cooking make the stuffing: Soak the mushrooms in the warm water in a bowl for at least 30 minutes until softened.  Lift out the mushrooms squeezing the excess liquid back into the bowl and coarsely chop them. Set the mushrooms and soaking liquid aside separately.  Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet until hot. Add the onion and celery and saute for 3 minutes. Add the herbes de Provence garlic and mushrooms mix well and remove from the heat. Toast the bread slices well. Cut them into &#8540;-inch croutons. (You should have 3 cups.) Stir the croutons and raisins into the onion mixture.  Pour the reserved mushroom-soaking liquid into a measuring cup leaving behind the sandy residue in the bottom of the bowl. (You should have about  3/4 cup.) Add the soaking liquid salt and pepper to the onion mixture and toss gently to combine. Pack lightly into a loaf pan and cover with aluminum foil.  About 45 minutes before the turkey is done put the loaf of stuffing in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Then keep warm in a warm spot or in the turned-off oven.  While the turkey rests make the gravy: Push the cooking juices and vegetable from the roasting pan through a sieve or a food mill into a saucepan. Let rest for 4 to 5 minutes until most of the fat has risen to the top then skim off as much of it as possible. (You should have approximately 2 cups cooking juices.)  Add the diced neck gizzard and heart to the cooking juices bring to a simmer and simmer for 5 minutes to reduce the liquid slightly. Stir in the dissolved potato starch and soy sauce until smooth. Pour into a sauceboat or serving bowl.  Carve the turkey and serve it with the gravy and stuffing. 
One Pot Chicken and Orzo,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/One Pot Chicken and Orzo,4 to 6 servings,  2 1/2 to 3 pounds bone-in skin-on chicken thighs trimmed of excess fat 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 teaspoon butter 12 ounces (2 cups) orzo pasta 1 1/2 cups chopped onion (about 1 medium onion)  2 cloves garlic minced 2&#188 ;cups chicken stock  3/4-cup canned crushed tomatoes (including juices)   1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon salt 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley   , To save time while the chicken is browning prep the onion garlic and parsley. You can easily swap out the thighs for bone-in skin-on chicken breasts. Depending on the size of the pieces you may want to cut them in half. If you use boneless skinless thighs or breasts do not brown them as long in the first step. They will not need as much cooking time as the bone-in skin-on thighs.  Prep and salt the chicken: Trim the chicken thighs of excess skin and fat. Sprinkle both sides with a little salt.  Brown the chicken thighs: Heat olive oil and melt butter on medium high heat in a large cast iron skillet (large enough to fit all of the chicken pieces) to coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot pat the chicken pieces dry on both sides with paper towels and place skin-side down in the pan. Let cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken has browned on one side. Then turn the chicken pieces over and cook for another 4 minutes until lightly browned. Remove the chicken from the skillet set aside.  Brown the orzo pasta add onions garlic: Add the orzo pasta to the skillet. Stir to coat and let the pasta brown. Once the orzo starts to brown stir in the chopped onions. Reduce the heat to medium and let cook stirring often for 2 to 3 minutes until the onions begin to soften. Add the minced garlic and cook a half minute more.  Stir together stock tomatoes salt pepper: In a large measuring cup stir together the chicken stock crushed tomatoes 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon of salt.  Add back chicken pour stock mixture over orzo: Place the chicken pieces skin-side up on top of the orzo. Pour the stock tomato mixture over the orzo. Increase heat to medium high and let the stock in the skillet come to a full boil.  Cover and cook: Lower the heat to the lowest heat you need to maintain a bare simmer. Cover and let cook until the orzo has completely absorbed the liquid and the chicken is cooked through about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.  Taste for salt and pepper and add more if needed. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley to serve.   
Genmaicha Madeleines,Kristina Cho Eat Cho Food,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Genmaicha Madeleines,10,  85g (6 tbsp) unsalted butter see recipe note below 10g (1 tbsp) genmaicha tea leaves 62g ( 1/2 cup) all-purpose flour  1/2 tsp baking powder  3/4 tsp coarse salt 34g (2 tbsp) granulated sugar 1 egg 20g (1 tbsp) honey  1/2 tsp vanilla Powdered sugar for dusting    , In a small saucepan melt butter over medium low heat. Add tea and simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off heat and allow the tea to steep for 10 minutes. Strain the infused butter through a mesh sieve press down on the leaves to extract as much butter as you can. You will need 50g of melted butter. In a medium bowl whisk to combine flour baking powder and salt. In another medium bowl combine sugar and egg. Whisk with handheld beaters at medium high speed until pale and tripled in size for 8 to 9 minutes. Add honey and vanilla and mix for another minute. Sift half of the flour mixture into the egg and sugar mixture and gently fold in with a flexible spatula. Once incorporated sift the remaining flour and fold in. Add the butter and fold in until the batter is smooth and thick. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 45 to 60 minutes until firm but scoopable. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly brush the madeleine pan with melted butter or lightly spray with nonstick spray. Fill each mold with a little more than a tablespoon of batter. No need to spread or level the batter. Bake until the edges are lightly golden brown the center is puffy 9 to 12 minutes. Allow the madeleines to cool in the pan for 5 minutes and then remove from the mold to continue cooling on a wire rack. Dust with powdered sugar and enjoy warm or at room temperature.  Recipe notes: 85g (6 tbsp) unsalted butter is how much you will need to infuse the butter with tea. However once you strain out the tea leaves you will be left with less than that because some of the butter will be absorbed by the leaves. You will need 50g which is a little less than 4 tbsp of melted butter for your batter.

Each quadrant represents one of the four seasons and we have chosen our four favorite pizza toppings to represent each one.  Place a pizza stone in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Allow the pizza stone to preheat for at least 30 minutes  To prepare the tomato sauce:    Heat a small saucepan on medium heat and add olive oil. Add onions and garlic and stir to coat with the oil. Cook stirring occasionally until onions are soft about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes and red pepper flakes. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Let sauce simmer quite furiously stirring occasionally to let the liquid cook down about 20 minutes. Lower the heat if the sauce starts to stick. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Transfer tomato sauce to a small mixing bowl. Set aside.  To prepare toppings:    To a skillet set over medium heat add olive oil. When oil is shimmering add sliced mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook stirring occasionally until mushrooms are golden brown about 5 minutes.   To make the pizza:    Once your stone is preheated start rolling out your dough. Dust work surface with flour. Flatten one dough ball to a thickness of  1/2 inch and roll to desired diameter. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with another piece of parchment and proceed with remaining dough.   Dust a pizza peel with cornmeal and place a dough round on the peel. Give the peel a little shake to make sure the dough moves freely and is not sticking. Lightly spread about 2 to 3 tablespoons of sauce onto the dough.  Top dough with shredded mozzarella. Visually divide the dough into four quadrants Arrange each seasons' toppings in a quadrant. Working quickly open the oven and slide the pizza off the peel onto the pizza stone. Allow your pizza to cook until you have reached your desired crust about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and place on a cutting board. Let pizza rest for 1 to 2 minutes before you cut it. Repeat process with remaining dough and sauce.   To serve: Garnish pizza with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil. 
Seared Salmon With Saffron Hollandaise,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Seared Salmon With Saffron Hollandaise, 4 servings, Seared salmon:   4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets pin bones removed Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon vegetable oil    Saffron hollandaise:  1/4 cup dry white wine 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 1 medium shallot minced 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1/8 teaspoon saffron threads steeped in 1 tablespoon warm water 3 large egg yolks 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter melted  Sea salt  2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice plus more as needed   1 tablespoon minced chives   , To prepare the salmon: Season fillets generously on both sides with salt and pepper. To a large nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat add oil. When oil is shimmering add the salmon fillets flesh side down and sear on both sides until nicely browned and the flesh is no longer translucent in the thickest part of the fillet 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove salmon from skillet and place on a large plate; tent with foil to keep warm while you prepare the sauce.   To prepare the sauce: In a small saucepan combine wine vinegar shallots and peppercorns; cook until nearly dry. You should have about 1 tablespoon of liquid. Cool the reduction to room temperature then strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium heatproof bowl and combine with the saffron water.   To prepare the egg mixture: To a medium saucepan add water to reach 2 inches and bring to a simmer. Add egg yolks to the bowl with the reduction and place the bowl over the simmering water whisking constantly. To avoid overcooking the mixture be sure that the water is barely simmering with no visible signs of surface action just steam rising. As the egg yolks warm they increase in volume. If they become too warm and begin to coagulate around the sides and bottom remove from heat and cool slightly.  To prepare the hollandaise: When the yolks have tripled in volume and the mixture thickly coats the back of a spoon after about 5 minutes remove the bowl from the simmering water. Stabilize the bowl and begin adding the melted butter in a slow thin stream whisking constantly as it is incorporated. The sauce will begin to thicken as more butter is added. When the hollandaise is thick velvety and coats the back of a spoon add the lemon juice and taste and adjust seasoning with salt and additional lemon juice as needed. If too thick add a little warm water to thin the consistency.  If the sauce starts to break: It could be one of two things: either the butter was added too quickly or the egg mixture got too hot (scrambled eggs). To rescue a broken sauce try adding a small amount of boiling water and whisking until the sauce is smooth before adding more butter or add another egg yolk to a clean bowl and set back over simmering water; whisk until thickened and using a fine mesh strainer to catch the scrambled egg slowly strain the broken hollandaise gradually into the new egg yolk.  To serve: Place each salmon fillet on a warmed dinner plate and spoon hollandaise on top of each portion. Garnish with minced chives and serve immediately.

Vanilla Custard Sauce,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/dessert-sauces/Vanilla Custard Sauce,2 1/2 cups,  1 cup (8 ounces) whole milk 1 cup (8 ounces) heavy whipping cream  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar 1 vanilla bean or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 5 large egg yolks   , Custard sauce also known as creme anglaise is a smooth velvety sauce-it's a great companion for desserts that benefit from a pool of cool creaminess to highlight and complete their flavor and texture. Because it is a custard it may be flavored in many ways by infusing spices nuts citrus zest tea leaves and more into the milk portion before beginning the cooking process. Custard sauce is good to use when creating sauce designs on dessert plates as its light color contrasts well with chocolate caramel or raspberry sauces.  Fill the large bowl halfway with ice and water and set it aside. Combine the milk cream and sugar in the medium saucepan and warm over medium heat stirring occasionally until the sugar is dissolved. Use the tip of a paring knife to cut the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Turn the knife over and use the dull side to scrape out the seeds and add both the seeds and the pod to the saucepan. Heat until the mixture just begins to simmer. Remove from the heat and let steep for 30 minutes or until you like the flavor.  Heat the milk mixture to just below the boiling point. Remove the pan from the heat. In the small bowl whisk the egg yolks together. Slowly pour about 1 cup of the hot milk into the yolk mixture whisking constantly to temper the yolks. Slowly pour the yolk mixture back into the hot milk in the saucepan whisking all the while. Return to medium-low heat and cook stirring constantly with the spatula until the custard thickens and registers 178&deg; to 180&deg;F on the thermometer.  Immediately strain the custard sauce through the strainer set over the medium bowl to remove any tiny bits of scrambled egg. (Save the vanilla bean: Rinse it thoroughly allow to dry then use it to make vanilla sugar) If you're using vanilla extract instead of the vanilla bean add it now and whisk to blend. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the sauce then set the bowl into the bowl of ice water. Once the custard sauce has completely cooled use or store in the refrigerator until needed.  Storing: Keep the custard sauce for up to 5 days from the day it was made refrigerated in an airtight container with a piece of plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming.   
Duo-Tone Chocolate Pots de Creme,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Duo-Tone Chocolate Pots de Creme,6 servings,  Custard: 7 ounces good-quality milk chocolate finely chopped 1 large egg 4 large egg yolks 1 3/4 cups heavy whipping cream 1 3/4 cups whole milk  3/4 cup sugar  Ganache 1 1/2 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate (up to 64 percent cacao)  5 tablespoons heavy whipping cream Softly Whipped Cream and milk or dark chocolate curls for serving   , Milk Chocolate is often overlooked in the quest for the newest and darkest offerings but it's still a favorite-with kids and adults alike. Its presence is a surprise in this recipe as the luscious milk chocolate custard is hidden under a thin layer of warm chocolate ganache. So although the spoon dips into a dark surface it comes out with a lighter custard full of the malty caramel-like qualities of milk chocolate. The interplay of cool milky sweetness against warm dark richness is sublime.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center.  Make the custard: Place the chopped chocolate in the medium bowl. Combine the egg and egg yolks in the small bowl. Heat the cream milk and sugar in the medium saucepan over medium heat until just before the mixture boils. Immediately pour it over the chopped chocolate. Let it sit for 1 minute then whisk gently but thoroughly to completely blend the mixture. Add the whole egg and yolks whisking to incorporate thoroughly.  Strain and bake the custard: Pour the custard through the strainer into the pitcher. Place the custard cups in the large roasting pan making sure they don't touch and divide the warm custard among them. Pull out the oven rack and place the pan on the rack; then remove one of the cups pour enough hot tap water (not boiling) into that area to come halfway up the sides of the cups and replace the cup. Cut a piece of foil large enough to fit just inside the edges of the pan then lay the foil across the top of the cups making sure it doesn't touch the custard. You may need to smooth and flatten the foil on the counter if any wrinkles touch the custard. Gently push the rack back into the oven shut the oven door and bake the custards for 50 to 60 minutes just until the edges of the custards are set-there should still be a dime-size liquid area in the very center of the custard (test by gently tapping the side of the pan).  Remove the foil and then the pan from the oven being careful not to tilt the pan and splash water on top of the custards. Set the pan on a heatproof surface. Use the tongs (or your hand protected by a kitchen towel) to immediately remove the cups from the water bath and place them on a rack to cool to room temperature about 40 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold at least 4 hours or overnight.  Add the ganache layer: Place the chopped semisweet chocolate in the cleaned small bowl. Heat the cream in the small saucepan over medium heat just until it begins to simmer (do not allow the cream to boil and evaporate). Immediately pour the cream over the chocolate. Allow the mixture to sit undisturbed for 1 minute then gently stir with the spatula until thoroughly blended and smooth. Spoon a tablespoon of ganache onto the surface of each custard then gently swirl each cup until the dark chocolate completely covers the custard. (If the ganache seems too thick to spread easily heat another tablespoon of cream and add it to the mixture).  Serve the custards immediately while the ganache is still warm or refrigerate up to 1 hour. As the ganache chills it begins to harden and pull away from the sides of the cup losing its silken texture and exposing the custard beneath thereby spoiling the surprise. Serve each with a spoonful of whipped cream topped with a scattering of chocolate curls if you like.  Photo by: Bianca Dodson

Sous Vide Poached Salmon with Beets and Cucumber Creme Fraiche,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Sous Vide Poached Salmon with Beets and Cucumber Creme Fraiche,4 servings, Beets  2 medium red beets 3 tablespoons butter 2 teaspoons sugar  1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon hazelnut oil   Salmon  4 5-6 ounce salmon fillets skinned 8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil divided 8 fresh dill sprigs 4 tablespoons dry white wine divided Salt and white pepper to taste   Cucumber Creme Fra&#238;che   3/4 cup creme fra&#238;che  1/3 English cucumber seeded and peeled 1 tablespoon fresh dill chopped fine Dill sprigs for garnish   , Celebrated by chefs from Heston Blumenthal to Thomas Keller cooking sous vide calls for slowly heating vacuum-sealed food in water at low temperatures locking in natural juices and flavors lost with other methods. Fish meat poultry and vegetables cook for hours even days with stunning results every time. The object is to cook the items evenly and not to overcook the outside while keeping the inside at the same "doneness" keeping the food succulent.   This recipe was tested with the Sansaire immersion water circulator. Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device's owner's manual for proper cooking times food-handling and safety procedures.   Discover more about sous vide cooking with the Sansaire:  Click here »  For the beets preheat oven to 350 degrees F. If beet greens are still attached trim to 1" length and scrub beets. Place in a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to enclose beets. Add butter sugar and salt wrap foil around beets and place in oven. Roast until tender about 1- 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and cool enough to handle. Unwrap beets and rub off the skins with a kitchen towel or a peeler. Cut the beets into  3/4" cubes toss with hazelnut oil season with salt and pepper and set aside.  For the salmon choose a pot large enough to hold your food with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the pot using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator turning the silver temperature ring above the display to 132 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.  Season salmon portions generously with salt and white pepper. Place each salmon fillet in a separate zip lock bag with 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 dill sprigs and 1 tablespoon white wine. Seal the bags and refrigerate until cold about 30 minutes.   While refrigerating the salmon fillets whisk the creme fraiche until thickened. Grate the cucumber and fold into the creme fraiche along with the chopped dill. Refrigerate until ready to use.  To cook salmon place bags in the pot of water heated by the immersion circulator and cook at 132 degrees F for 10-12 minutes. Remove the bags from water with tongs and let rest at room temperature for 5 minutes.  To serve remove salmon fillets from bags and blot on paper towels. Place each fillet on a separate serving plate and garnish each with beet cubes and a dollop of cucumber creme fra&#238;che. Garnish with dill sprigs and serve immediately.

Basic Bread Oven Recipe,Le Creuset,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Basic Bread Oven Recipe,1 serving,   4 cups (550g) all purpose or bread flour  1 teaspoon (7g) kosher salt or coarse sea salt  1 teaspoon (4g) instant yeast  1 1/2 cups (360g) warm water (between 90°F-100°F)   Olive or vegetable oil   , Whisk together the flour salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer or large mixing bowl. Add the water and stir on low speed with the dough hook attachment for about 1 minute (or stir with a spatula). Increase speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic about 8-10 minutes (or alternately knead by hand). Every few minutes stop the mixer and scrape the dough off the hook and sides of the bowl. When the dough appears smooth cut off a small piece and stretch it. If it stretches to the point of transparency it’s kneaded enough. If not continue kneading.  Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and cover it with a pot lid or plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise until it has doubled in size and does not spring back when you push your finger into it about 1 1/2 ― 2 hours (less if it’s hot and humid more if it’s cold).  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead about 1-2 minutes to release the gas. Shape the dough roughly into a ball cover with a clean towel and let rest for 10 minutes.  Cup your hands around the dough and shape it into a tight ball by rolling it on the work surface between your palms. Lightly brush the base of the Bread Oven with oil. Place the dough in the center of the base and cover with the lid. Allow the dough to rise again until roughly doubled in size and when poked with a finger will slowly spring back about 30-60 minutes.  During the last 15 minutes of rising time preheat oven to 450°F. When ready to bake score the bread with a sharp knife or razor making an X or a hash mark to allow the dough to expand freely. Cover and place in the hot oven.  Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes until the bread is golden brown and cooked through. It should have an internal temperature of approximately 200°F when done. Carefully remove the bread from the base and allow to cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing. 
Brussels Sprouts Kimchi Puree and Bacon,All-Clad & Chef David Chang,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Brussels Sprouts Kimchi Puree and Bacon,4 servings,  1 lb Brussels sprouts  3/4 lb. good quality smoky bacon cut into 1" to 1 1/2" inch long batons 1 cup Napa Cabbage Kimchi (see below) pureed 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup julienned carrots Napa Cabbage Kimchi: 1 small to medium head Napa cabbage discolored or loose outer leaves discarded 2 tablespoons Kosher or coarse sea salt  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 20 garlic cloves minced 20 slices peeled fresh ginger minced  3/4 cup kochukaru (Korean chile powder)   3/4 cup fish sauce  3/4 cup usukuchi (light soy sauce)  2 teaspoons jarred salted shrimp  1/2 cup 1-inch pieces scallions (greens and whites)  1/2 cup julienned carrots   , Roasted Brussels sprouts tossed with bacon and served upon a bed of tangy Napa cabbage kimchi by Chef David Chang of Momofuku Restaurant Group.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Remove and discard the loose outer leaves from the sprouts and cut the sprouts in half through the core.  Put the bacon in an All-Clad 12" fry pan and cook over medium heat turning occasionally until just about crisp 5 minutes or so. With a slotted spoon transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and reserve.  Drain off most of the fat from the pan and add the sprouts cut side down in the same pan. Raise the heat to medium-high and sear until the sprouts begin to sizzle. Put the skillet in the oven and roast until the sprouts are deeply browned 8 minutes or so then shake the pan to redistribute them. Pull the pan from the oven when the sprouts are bright green and fairly tender (taste one to check) 10-15 minutes more.  Return the pan to the stovetop over medium heat and stir in the butter bacon and salt and pepper to taste. Toss the sprouts to coat them.  Divide the kimchi among four shallow bowls. Use the back of a spoon to spread the kimchi out so it covers the bottom of the bowls. Divide the sprouts among the bowls arranging them in a tidy pile on top of the kimchi. Garnish each with a pile of carrot julienne and serve.  Napa Cabbage Kimchi: We let the kimchi ferment for only a couple of weeks instead of allowing it to get really stinky and soft. There's a point after about two weeks where the bacteria that are fermenting the kimchi start producing CO2 and the kimchi takes on a prickly mouthfeel like the feeling of letting the bubbles in a soft drink pop on your tongue. It's right around then that I like it best.  Makes 1 to 1 1/2 quarts.  Cut the cabbage lengthwise in half then cut the halves crosswise into 1-inch-wide pieces. Toss the cabbage with the salt and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a bowl. Let sit overnight in the refrigerator.  Combine the garlic ginger kochukaru fish sauce soy sauce shrimp and remaining  1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl. If it is very thick add water  1/3 cup at a time until the brine is just thicker than a creamy salad dressing but no longer a sludge. Stir in the scallions and carrots.  Drain the cabbage and add it to the brine. Cover and refrigerate. Though the kimchi will be tasty in 24 hours it will be better in a week and at its prime in two weeks. It will still be good for another couple weeks after that though it will grow incrementally stronger and funkier.   
Grilled Rosemary Salmon with Nectarine Salsa,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Grilled Rosemary Salmon with Nectarine Salsa,4 servings,  1 medium shallot peeled and minced 2 large ripe nectarines pitted and diced 1 small red bell pepper cored and diced 1 jalape&#241;o chile stemmed seeded and minced 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 tablespoon minced cilantro   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons honey 1 medium garlic clove peeled and minced 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 1/2 tablespoons minced rosemary 4 (5-ounce) salmon fillets skin-on and pin-bones removed 1 tablespoon olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper   , This easy-to-make rosemary glaze complements the rich flavors of the fish while the salsa provides a sweet yet tangy contrast. Choose ripe nectarines to provide texture and sweetness to the salmon.  To prepare salsa:   Transfer the minced shallot in to a fine-mesh strainer and gently rinse under running water to remove any sharpness. Transfer to a medium bowl and add nectarines pepper jalape&#241;o lime juice and cilantro. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   To prepare glaze:   In a medium bowl use a whisk to combine the mustard honey garlic juice and rosemary. Place half of the glaze in a small bowl and set aside.

Spanish Tortilla with Smoked Paprika Aioli and Fried Sage,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Spanish Tortilla with Smoked Paprika Aioli and Fried Sage,4 to 6 servings,  Tortilla: 5 eggs room temperature  1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups olive oil  1/2 medium yellow onion sliced thin  1/2 pound Yukon gold potatoes sliced 1/8 inch thick         Smoked Paprika (Piment&#243;n) Aioli: 2 large egg yolks 1 medium garlic clove chopped  1/2 cup vegetable oil  3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons smoked paprika (piment&#243;n) 2 teaspoons lemon juice 2 to 3 teaspoons water if needed  8 fresh Sage leaves   , The name of this dish in Spanish refers to a cake made with olive oil eggs onion and potatoes and is everywhere in Spain.  This recipe is a classic version but a variety of things can be added to tortilla such as chorizo or seasonal vegetables. Serve tortilla day or night as a delicious tapa side or main dish.  In a large mixing bowl whisk together eggs and salt set aside.    In an 8-inch nonstick skillet with lid combine oil potatoes and onions. Cook on medium-low heat gently stirring the mixture occasionally for 5 to 7 minutes or until tender. Using a fine mesh strainer or a colander over a large mixing bowl carefully strain out the hot oil and reserve. (When cooled transfer oil to a sturdy container so it can be utilized again in future cooking.)  Fold warm potato and onions with the whisked eggs. Using the same warm skillet over medium heat add 1 tablespoon of reserved oil. When oil is shimmering add the egg mixture while shaking the pan gently so that it does not stick. Gently stir the eggs a couple of times with a heat resistant silicone spatula before leaving it to form a solid cake. Cover with lid and reduce the heat to medium-low.     While the tortilla is cooking gently slide a heat proof spatula around the edges of the tortilla a couple of times to prevent any sticking. When tortilla is 75 percent cooked through about 8 to 10 minutes remove from heat. Slide the tortilla out of the skillet onto a dinner plate and return the skillet to the heat. Invert a second plate over the tortilla and holding both plates together flip. Finally slide the tortilla back into the hot pan.   On medium heat repeat the process of gently shaking the pan while tucking the edges of the tortilla under with a spatula. Cook tortilla about 3 to 4 minutes or until firm then slide it onto a cutting board. Allow to rest for 5 minutes.  To prepare the aioli:  Crush garlic into a paste in a medium to large sized mortar and pestle. Add the egg yolk to the garlic and stir mixture rapidly while drizzling in oil (alternatively this process also works in a small food processor or a heavy mixing bowl with a medium soft whisk). When all the oil is combined the aioli will be very thick. To finish add lemon juice salt and paprika. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and the consistency with water as needed.       To fry sage: Add two tablespoons of oil to a medium skillet over medium high heat. When oil is shimmering add sage and gently fry until it turns dark green. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate and sprinkle with salt.   To serve: Arrange sage leaves over the top of the tortilla and slice into wedges or bite sized squares. Serve aioli in a bowl on the side or with small dollop on the side of each piece.

Rich Turkey Pan Gravy,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/appetizers/dips-spreads-sauces-seasonings/Rich Turkey Pan Gravy,4 cups,  4 to 5 cups homemade turkey stock (recipe follows) or chicken stock divided 10 medium shallots peeled and cut in half 4 large carrots peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces 4 large celery ribs trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces Pan drippings from turkey roasting pan 2 cups Merlot or other fruity red wine  3/4 cup all-purpose flour 6 sprigs fresh thyme 3 sprigs fresh sage Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  Homemade Turkey Stock: Reserved turkey giblets (neck gizzard heart) 2 pounds turkey legs cut into 3-inch pieces or chicken wing pieces 1 medium yellow onion peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 2 large carrots peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 2 large celery ribs trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces 4 cloves garlic peeled  3/4 cup vegetable or canola oil 6 cups water 1 teaspoon black peppercorns lightly crushed   , This rich pan sauce starts with a succulent base of pan juices and builds flavor with the addition of roasted vegetables red wine and fresh herbs. You can adapt this recipe for a prime rib roast by using a full-bodied red wine like Syrah and fresh rosemary instead of thyme and sage. Roast a few peeled garlic cloves with the vegetables for even more flavor.  Homemade Turkey Stock: Preheat oven to 425 degrees and place a rack in the center. In a large roasting pan place the giblets turkey pieces onions carrots celery garlic cloves and oil tossing to coat. Place roasting pan in preheated oven and cook stirring every 15 minutes until turkey and vegetables are a deep golden brown about 45 to 50 minutes.  Remove roasting pan from oven and place over low heat on stove top. Add water and peppercorns and stir with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits from the bottom and sides of the pan. Simmer until stock is richly flavored and reduced slightly about 2 hours. Don't allow the stock to boil; it should bubble gently. Remove stock from heat and allow stock to cool slightly.  Strain stock through a fine-mesh strainer into a large heatproof bowl and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.  Gravy: As the turkey roasts add turkey stock in  1/2 cup batches to pan as needed to prevent drippings from scorching. During the last  1/2 hour of roasting add shallots carrots and celery to pan stirring to coat with pan drippings.  When turkey finishes cooking remove the roasting pan from the oven and carefully remove the turkey and roasting rack. Place the turkey on a serving platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Allow the turkey to rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes.  While the turkey is resting carefully pour pan drippings into a fat separator. Pour drippings back into the roasting pan and discard fat. Place roasting pan across two burners and heat over medium-high heat. Add stock and wine stirring with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits clinging to the bottom and sides of the roasting pan. Cook until stock mixture comes to a boil. Sprinkle flour over pan juices and whisk vigorously until mixture is smooth. Reduce heat to medium-low and add thyme and sage sprigs. Simmer until gravy thickens and coats the back of a spoon about 10 to 15 minutes. Strain gravy through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium saucepan. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm.  Cook's Note: To keep lumps from forming when you whisk in the flour place the flour and 1 cup of stock tin a jar and seal tightly. Shake the jar vigorously to dissolve the flour in the liquid. Whisk the flour mixture into the pan drippings along with the remaining stock and wine.  Cook's Note: To keep your gravy warm while you finish last-minute dinner preparations pour your gravy in an insulated container made to hold hot liquids.

Chicken Pot Pie With Puff Pastry,Quin Liburd,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Chicken Pot Pie With Puff Pastry,6-7 servings,  1 lb boneless/skinless chicken breasts cooked and shredded  1/2 cup (1 stick) butter 1 cup celery hearts chopped 1  1/2 cups carrots chopped 1 cup leeks sliced thinly 2 teaspoons kosher salt plus more to taste 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper plus more to taste  1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika 1  1/2 cups baby dutch yellow potatoes chopped into quarters 5 garlic cloves chopped 4 sprigs fresh thyme de-stemmed  1/2 cup all purpose flour 2 cups chicken stock plus more to preference 2 cups half and half 2 bay leaves 1 cup frozen peas 1 (17.3 ounce) store bought frozen puff pastry thawed 1 egg + 1 tablespoon water mixed together for egg wash   , Before you begin take the puff pastry out of the freezer to thaw according to package directions. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees  F and prepare your baking vessel(s) - oven safe mini ramekins pie plate baking dish etcetera and place vessels onto a large baking sheet for good measure. In a large dutch oven or pot over medium heat melt the butter. Once the butter is sizzling add in the celery carrots and leeks. Season the vegetables with salt pepper garlic powder and smoked paprika. Stir everything together and allow the vegetables to saute until lightly they become softened and turn golden brown about 6-7 minutes. Add in the potatoes garlic and fresh thyme and continue stirring the mixture together to fully incorporate. Allow the potatoes to cook until they are fork tender about 7-10 minutes. Add in the flour and stir to combine with all ingredients. The flour should fully coat all of the vegetables/potato mixture continue cooking together for another 2 minutes. Pour in the stock and stir mixture to combine. At this stage you should see the stock absorb the flour and fully dissolve. Then pour in the half and half along with the bay leaves. Stir the mixture together again and allow everything to come up to a nice simmer about 4-5 minutes. Lastly add in the shredded chicken and frozen peas. Stir everything together to fully combine. Allow everything to cook together for another 2-3 minutes. The overall filling should be somewhat thick. If you prefer your filling to be more loose/runny add in more stock 1/2 cup at a time until desired consistency is reached. Then remove the filling from the heat. Cut the puff pastry according to the size of your vessel of choice. If using mini ramekins you can turn them upside down on the puff pastry to measure out the size (with extra hang room) and cut using a sharp knife. Use a knife to cut a slit/hole in the center and set the puff pastry aside. Empty the filling into your desired vessels leaving about 1/2 inch of room at the top as this will help when the pie filling bubbles and boils up. Wipe/clean the rim if necessary. Gently place the thawed puff pastry over the vessel(s). Then use egg wash and gently brush all over the top of the puff pastry. Bake chicken pot pie for 20-25 minutes or until the puff pastry is golden brown in color. Allow pot pie to cool for 10 minutes and then serve warm. Enjoy! 
Classic Mini Margherita Pizzas,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/pizza/Classic Mini Margherita Pizzas,8 (5-inch) pizzas,  1 recipe Neapolitan Pizza Dough (ingredients below) Corn meal as needed  Extra-virgin olive oil as needed for brushing the dough  4 to 6 fresh San Marzano or roma tomatoes sliced  1 pound of fresh mozzarella or buffalo mozzarella sliced  16 fresh basil leaves torn into pieces   Neapolitan Pizza Dough: makes 8 individual (5-inch) pizzas 2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour plus more as needed and for work surface  2 teaspoons granulated sugar  1 teaspoon kosher salt   1 envelope (2 3/4 teaspoons) instant yeast 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil plus more for oiling the bowl   , In 1889 Queen Margherita walked out of the opera feeling a little hungry.  She stopped at a restaurant and asked for something to snack on. Thrilled that the queen was in their restaurant the chef prepared a pizza with sliced tomatoes fresh mozzarella and basil to match the colors of the Italian flag. Thus the modern day pizza was born!  Authentic Neapolitan pizza dough is a simple thin-crust pizza dough that originated in Naples in the 1800s. Originally pizzas in Naples were made with a simple tomato sauce and vegetables. Cheese did not become a usual topping until the 1880s.  Make the dough: Place flour sugar salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds to combine. With mixer running on low speed add water and olive oil and mix for 1 minute to combine. Increase speed to medium and process until dough forms a slightly sticky ball about 1 to 2 minutes. If ball does not form add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time and continue mixing until ball forms. Coat a large mixing bowl with a thin film of olive oil. Transfer dough ball to prepared mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest until doubled in volume about 1- 1/2 to 2 hours.   When dough is ready press it gently to remove air bubbles and turn out on a lightly floured work surface. Using a bench scraper divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a tight ball cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for 15 minutes before baking.  Make the pizza: Place a pizza stone in the lower third of your oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Allow the pizza stone to preheat for at least 30 minutes.   Once your stone is preheated you can start rolling out your dough. Dust work surface with flour. Flatten one dough ball to a thickness of  1/2 inch and roll to a diameter of about 5 inches keeping the remaining dough covered.   Transfer dough round to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with another piece of parchment. Continue rolling dough and placing on the baking sheet separating layers of rolled dough with additional sheets of parchment as needed. Cover stack of dough rounds with plastic wrap and set aside.  Sprinkle a pizza peel with some cornmeal and place a dough round on the peel. Give the peel a little shake to make sure that the dough moves freely and is not sticking. Using a pastry brush lightly brush about 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over the pizza base. Arrange the tomatoes and mozzarella over the pizza base.  Open the oven and slide the pizza off of the peel onto the pizza stone. Allow your pizza to cook until you have reached your desired crust about 5 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and place on a cutting board. If you let the pizza rest for 1 to 2 minutes before you cut it as it will be easier to cut.   To serve: Garnish each pizza with about 1 to 2 torn basil leaves. Serve immediately.   Tips for Using a Pizza Stone   Before its first use wash the stone with water. Never use detergent.  Place the stone in a cold oven and preheat the oven. Typically pizza is baked at the maximum oven temperature between 500 to 550-degrees. Store the stone on the lowest rack of the oven so it's always handy for baking pizza or bread. Do not use the stone to bake breads with high-fat content because the fat will stain the porous stone.  Tips for Using a Pizza Peel   To prevent sticking sprinkle the peel with flour cornmeal or semolina before sliding it under the uncooked pizza crust or loaf of bread.  Place the pizza-shaped dough on the peel and then add the toppings.  Reach the peel into the oven and angle it downward. Shake it gently until the pizza slowly slides off the peel onto the stone.

Keep them on a parchment paper and covered with a towel for 10 minutes.   Heat a flat griddle on the stove on medium heat. Now flatten each round dough piece. Sprinkle some flour on the board where you will roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Start rolling out the dough into a round shape or elongated shape. It should roll out to about 7 to 8 inches diameter. Spread about 1 tsp grated garlic and 1 tsp chopped cilantro onto the rolled dough and press it lightly with your hands. Gently brush the griddle with vegetable oil.  Now lay the rolled out dough garlic-side down onto the griddle and let it puff up for 2 minutes. You will see air pockets form on the surface.

Strawberry-Rhubarb Tart,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Strawberry-Rhubarb Tart,1 (9-inch) tart,  1 recipe Perfect Pie Crust (ingredients below) 5 tablespoons good-quality strawberry jam  1 tablespoon brandy  2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest  1 pint (16 ounces) fresh strawberries rinsed dried hulled and quartered 5 cups (about 1- 3/4 pounds) fresh rhubarb rinsed dried trimmed cut into  1/2-inch pieces 1 cup granulated sugar  3 tablespoons cornstarch Finely grated zest of 1 orange    The Perfect Crust Recipe adapted from The Art and Soul of Baking by Sur La Table and Cindy Mushet. Yields 1 9-inch pie crust.   1- 3/4 (6- 3/4 ounces) cups all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes  3/4 to 1/3 cup ice water   , A classic springtime combination strawberries and rhubarb cook together to form a deliciously sweet and tart filling. The dough can be made up to 2 days in advance and kept chilled or make it weeks in advance and freeze until needed.   The pie dough recipe can be used to make both sweet and savory pies and tarts. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month. You can also save more time by making the dough in the food processor. Place the flour and cold butter in the processor bowl and pulse to cut the butter into the flour then transfer to a large mixing bowl and proceed with the recipe. Make sure to weigh your ingredients for best results.  To make the Perfect Crust dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring.  Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.    To prepare tart crust: Remove dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll chilled dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until the circle measures 15 inches wide and 1/8 inch thick.   Starting at one edge roll the dough around the rolling pin and lay it gently on top of a 9-inch tart pan. Gently press the dough into the crevices of the pan. Roll your thumb or a rolling pin over the rim of the pan to remove any excess dough reserving the dough scraps. Chill the lined pan for at least 30 minutes.   Preheat oven to 375 degrees and place a rack in the center.   To prepare the berry glaze: Stir together strawberry jam brandy and lemon zest in a small saucepan. Warm over medium-low heat stirring for 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.   To prepare the filling and bake: In a large mixing bowl toss together strawberries rhubarb sugar cornstarch and orange zest. Scrape the fruit mixture into the tart shell spreading it evenly. Brush the berry glaze over the fruit.   Set the tart pan on a rimmed baking sheet place in preheated oven and bake until the crust is nicely browned and the filling is bubbly around the edge about 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer the tart to a wire rack to cool.

Tomato & Eggplant Rice with Toasted Almonds,All-Clad & Chef Hugh Acheson,home/recipes/side-dishes/pasta-grains-legumes/Tomato & Eggplant Rice with Toasted Almonds,4 servings,  2 cups jasmine rice (soaked for 8 hours in 3 cups water 1 teaspoon sea salt 2 tablespoons lemon juice-**use the measuring cup provided with All Clad Grain Cooker)  2 tablespoons olive oil  1/2 cup sweet onion diced 2 tablespoons fresh ginger peeled and minced 1 1/2  teaspoons fresh serrano small diced 2 teaspoons ground turmeric 1 teaspoon garam marsala 3 cardamom pods 1 1/2 cups Roma tomatoes chopped (about 2 Roma tomatoes)  1 1/2 cups eggplant cubed 2 teaspoons salt plus a little extra to taste 1 3/4 cups chicken stock (**use measuring cup provided with the All Clad Grain Cooker)   3/4 cup slivered almonds 1 cup Greek yogurt  1/2 cup green onion thinly sliced   ,  This is a great "one pot" dish recipe inspired by a south Indian classic-Tomato rice.   Preparing this recipe in the All-Clad Rice & Grain Cooker is an excellent choice and will free up valuable stove top space. This recipe uses some wonderfully aromatic ingredients and has just a hint of spiciness. This dish works well as a side or could be great as a meal on its own if you’re into that sort of thing. (I am.)  First using a fine mesh strainer strain the soaked rice and give it a quick rinse under cold water. Set aside.   Set the All-Clad Rice & Grain Cooker to the "SAUTÉ" setting and press start. Add olive oil and let heat for 1 minute.   Once the oil begins to shimmer add the onion ginger serrano and cook for 1 minute. Add turmeric garam marsala and cardamom pods and cook for another 2 minutes.   Next add the tomatoes and eggplant. Season with salt and cook for 3 minutes more. (Tip: Don’t cook these portions any longer than needed as the onions and eggplant will continue to cook with the rice once it’s added.)   Now add strained and rinsed rice to the cooker and stir well with the other ingredients. Set the cooker to the WHITE RICE setting and press start. Add chicken stock and cover with the lid.   The grain cooker will give you a little *beep* of reassurance once it starts counting down at the 8 minute mark so don’t open that lid to check how things are going. Trust that little cooker!   While the rice is cooking place a medium sauté pan over medium high heat. Add the slivered almonds and toast for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown. Keep a close watch and stir often. Those slivered almonds are testy and will burn quickly if left unattended.   Once rice timer goes off remove the lid and use the plastic spoon/spatula stir the rice to make sure everything is evenly mixed. Season with salt to your liking.   To serve separate the rice into four bowls. Garnish each bowl of rice with  3/4 cup of Greek yogurt with a sprinkling of toasted almonds and sliced green onions.    
Sweet Potato Pie with Pecan Streusel,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Sweet Potato Pie with Pecan Streusel,1 (9-inch) pie,  All purpose flour for dusting work surface 1 recipe Perfect Pie Crust   Filling: 1 pound sweet potatoes preferably Jewel 4 tablespoons unsalted butter melted  3/4 cup granulated sugar  3/4 cup tightly packed light brown sugar 2 large eggs 1 large egg yolk  3/4 cup whole milk 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  Pecan Streusel: 1 stick unsalted butter room temperature  3/4 cup packed light brown sugar  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup all-purpose flour  3/4 cup chopped pecans   , If you think sweet potato pie and pumpkin pie are interchangeable then think again! The smooth velvety sweet potato layer is topped with a nutty streusel and we bet this pie will be a hit at any Thanksgiving buffet table.  Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F and position a rack in the center.   To prepare pie: Lightly flour a work surface and draw a 12-inch circle in the flour. This guide will be the perfect size for a standard 9-inch pie dish. Place 1 recipe of pie crust in the center of the circle and dust a little flour on top. Using the circle as a guide roll out the dough into a 12-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over a 9-inch pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Trim the dough so that it overhangs by 1 inch. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.   To prepare sweet potatoes: While the pie dough is chilling prepare the sweet potatoes. Use a fork to poke the sweet potatoes all over and arrange them on a large foil-lined baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until tender about 1 hour.  To blind bake the pie dough: Line base with foil and fill with pie weights. Place pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet and blind bake pastry crust for 15 minutes. Remove pie weights and foil and prick base with a fork. Bake 15 to 17 minutes longer. Remove pan from oven and place on a wire rack to cool. The pie shell is now ready to be filled.  To prepare filling: Peel the cooked potatoes and place the flesh into a food processor fitted with a metal blade and process until smooth. Add the melted butter granulated and brown sugars the eggs egg yolk milk vanilla bean paste cinnamon nutmeg and salt to the food processor and process until smooth.  To prepare streusel topping: In a bowl use a wooden spoon to thoroughly combine the butter brown sugar salt flour and pecans.   To assemble pie: Pour the filling into the pie crust and scatter the streusel over the top. Transfer to the oven to bake until the filling is set but slightly wobbly about 45 to 50 minutes. Remove the pie from oven and place onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool for 2 hours prior to serving. The pie center will solidify as the pie cools.

Palmiers,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Palmiers,30 (3-inch) pastries,  2-3c. Turbinado sugar 1 batch quickest puff pastry or 2 sheets frozen puff pastry thawed and unfolded into a rectangle   , Also known as palm trees or elephant ears these French puff pastries are easy-to-make elegant bites of crunchy-sweetness.   Scatter  1/2 c. sugar on the work surface and place the dough on top.  Scatter another  1/2 c. of sugar over the dough.  Press the sugar into the dough with a rolling pin.  Turn the dough over and make sure the sugar sticks to it.  If the dough begins to stick to the work surface add more sugar to roll it out.  Fold both outer edges of the dough in toward the middle from the top and bottom.  Then fold the rectangle of dough in half left to right.  Finally fold the bottom edge up to the top one.  Set aside any remaining sugar on a small plate.  Press the dough lightly with the palm of your hand then chill it for about 30 minutes or until firm. (The dough may be left until the next day before baking.  Do not be alarmed if most of the sugar melts.)  Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Slice the folded dough every  1/3-in. and dip the cut sides into the reserved sugar before placing on a Silpat or parchment lined baking sheet. Leave at least 2 inches of space on all sides of each palmier because they spread.  Bake for about 20 minutes until they are well caramelized.  If the heat of the oven is uneven it may be necessary to remove some of the pastries from the pan and return the others to the oven to finish baking.  Let the color of the caramelized sugar be your guide; it should be deep amber not brown.  Cool the pastries on a rack and serve them warm for best flavor.  
Classic Fudgy Brownies,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Classic Fudgy Brownies,16 (2-inch) brownies,   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces 4 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate finely chopped 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate finely chopped 1 cup sugar 2 large eggs at room temperature 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract  1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour Pinch of salt  1/2 cup chocolate chips or chunks (optional)  1/2 cup chopped nuts of your choice toasted and cooled (optional)   , Rich dark fudgy and slightly chewy these homemade brownies are always a hit so much better than anything you can buy. Serve cold with a glass of milk or warm from the oven with a scoop of ice cream. Like a simple black dress they can be accessorized to match any occasion. For a casual snack serve them right out of the pan. For something a bit dressier dust the brownies with a layer of powdered sugar. Or drizzle melted dark chocolate (or dark milk and/or white chocolate) wildly over the top.  Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Line an 8-inch square cake pan with foil or parchment paper across the bottom and up two of the sides then lightly coat with an oil spray.  Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in the bottom of a double boiler. Place the butter semisweet chocolate and unsweetened chocolate in the top of the double boiler (off the heat). Turn off the heat then set the butter and chocolate over the steaming water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted and smooth.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar. Whisk in the eggs one at a time stirring well to incorporate each before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla. Whisk in the flour and salt. Continue to stir until the batter changes from dull and broken-looking to smooth and shiny about 1 minute. Whisk in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts if using.  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until a skewer inserted into the center of the brownies comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it (do not overbake). Transfer to a rack and cool completely.  Run a thin knife or flexible spatula around the edges of the pan to loosen the brownies. Grasp the foil or parchment paper extending up the sides and pull gently upward. Set the brownies on a cutting surface and cut into 16 equal pieces. Since these are fudgy keep a hot wrung-out wet towel nearby so you can wipe the knife clean between slices. You could also serve the brownies right out of the pan if you like pressing a piece of plastic wrap against any cut surfaces and across the top to keep them fresh. Tightly wrap the remaining brownies in plastic or place in an airtight container. They will keep well at room temperature for 2 to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Transfer the berries to a 9-inch cast-iron skillet pie dish or cake pan (a 9 x 13-inch baking dish will also work in a pinch) and top with the shortcakes.   Brush the tops of the shortcakes with the cream and sprinkle with the brown sugar. Bake until the shortcakes are golden brown and the juices of the strawberries have thickened and bubbled up around the edges of the skillet 25 to 30 minutes.   Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before digging in (this will not only prevent unnecessary mouth burns but letting it cool a bit will help set the juices so it is not too runny).

Beef tenderloin roasts faster than a prime rib and is easy to serve making it a simple and satisfying main dish for this festive meal. Ask your butcher to cut from the head end of the tenderloin. You can also save a little money on this pricey cut by buying it untrimmed and removing excess fat yourself. Make sure to watch the pan drippings during roasting and add water or stock to prevent them from browning too much. You'll want to use those flavorful bits of roasted goodness for your pan sauce.   Preheat oven to 450 degrees F and place a rack in the center. Allow roast to sit at room temperature 1 hour before cooking.   Place a large heavy roasting pan across two burners add oil and heat over medium-high heat. Generously season the tenderloin with salt and pepper. Using tongs carefully place the tenderloin in the pan and sear on all sides until well browned about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove pan from heat remove tenderloin and place on a heatproof cutting board. Place a large roasting rack inside the roasting pan. Place tenderloin on rack and scatter vegetables across bottom of pan. Place pan in oven and roast until a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the tenderloin registers 120  degrees F about 35 to 40 minutes.    Remove pan from oven and carefully transfer tenderloin and rack to heatproof cutting board. Tent loosely with foil and allow roast to rest for at least 10 minutes. Internal temperature of the tenderloin will rise about 5 degrees  as it rests.   Strain pan drippings through a fine-mesh strainer pressing on solids to remove all liquid. Pour strained drippings into a fat separator and pour off degreased drippings discarding fat. Return drippings to roasting pan and place over two burners. Heat over medium-high heat and add shallots. Cook stirring constantly until softened about 4 to 5 minutes. Add wine stock rosemary and peppercorns stirring bottom of roasting pan with a wooden spoon to release browned bits.

Red Wine-Braised Short Ribs,All-Clad & Chef Barbara Lynch,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Red Wine-Braised Short Ribs,6 servings,  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6-8 lbs. meaty bone-in short ribs 2 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil plus more if needed 1 large onion chopped 3 celery stalks peeled and chopped 1 large carrot peeled and chopped 1 head garlic separated and individual cloves peeled 1 750ml bottle dry red wine 6 fresh thyme sprigs 4 bay leaves 1 tablespoon black peppercorns 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 tomato chopped 6 cups low-sodium beef broth or chicken broth preferably roasted chicken stock 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 1/2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh thyme leaves   , Rich flavorful tender. Comfort food slow-cooked to perfection and elevated to fine dining.  Heat the oven to 275 degrees F. Sprinkle a good amount of salt and some pepper all over the ribs. Heat the oil in a large All-Clad skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the ribs in batches if necessary on all sides. Be sure there is room around the ribs so that they sear instead of steam and be patient turning only after they have browned on one side. The browning step should take 10-12 minutes. As the ribs are browned transfer them to an All-Clad 4-Quart Weeknight Pan. Leave about 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat in the skillet and pour off any excess. Return the fry pan to medium-high heat and add the onion celery carrot and garlic. Cook stirring until the vegetables are tender and nicely browned about 8 minutes. Add the red wine thyme sprigs bay leaves peppercorns coriander and tomato and cook stirring occasionally until the liquid is reduced by half about 15 minutes. Add the broth bring to a boil and pour the liquid over the ribs in the baking dish. Cover the pan and cook in the oven until fork-tender 4 to 5 hours; some of the meat may fall off the bones which is okay. Let the meat cool in the braising liquid until it is almost room temperature. Transfer the ribs meat side down to another baking dish. Strain the braising liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a large saucepan. Ladle some of the braising liquid over the ribs to keep them moist; you want about  1/2 inch of liquid in the dish. If serving the ribs immediately spoon off any fat on the surface of the braised liquid. If not serving right away refrigerate the ribs and the braising liquid separately covered with plastic wrap until ready to serve. You can then remove the fat that has solidified on the top of the liquid once cooled which is easier and more thorough. To serve heat the oven to 300 degrees F. Bring the defatted braising liquid to a simmer over medium heat and cook skimming occasionally until reduced to about 1 1/3 cup about 30 minutes. (If the reduction is done before the meat is sufficiently heated just take it off the heat.) You don't want the liquid come to a rolling boil but you do want to see tiny bubbles coming to the surface. Meanwhile gently reheat the ribs in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes. Just before serving whisk the butter and chopped thyme leaves into the reduced braising liquid. Divide the ribs among six plates and top with the sauce.

Wrap the dough in plastic wrap place one disc into the freezer for a later use and the other in the fridge to chill overnight for the tart.    Blood Orange Curd   When ready to bake tart remove your dough from the fridge and place on the counter. Allow the dough to come to room temperature for about 15 minutes.  Remove the plastic wrap and roll out the dough so it fits into the 9 inch tart pan. Be sure to lift the dough occasionally to keep it from sticking.  Place the dough into the tart pan and press firmly against the sides and bottom without stretching the dough.  Trim off any excess dough. Pop the tart pan in the fridge for at least 30 minutes prior to baking.  Once ready to bake preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Prick the dough all over with a fork. Lightly cover the tart pan with aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes remove the aluminum foil and continue to bake the dough for an additional 5 minutes. Once the crust is light golden brown remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before adding the filling.  While the crust is cooling make the Blood Orange Curd.  In a heavy bottomed pot stir together the egg yolks and sugar whisking for one minute until pale in color. Add in the juice from the blood oranges cornstarch and butter then continue to whisk until the curd thickens and reaches 170 degrees.  Strain the curd in a fine mesh strainer over a bowl.  Pour the strained curd into the crust being sure to spread evenly.  Cool the tart for at least 2 hours prior to serving. Enjoy!

To enhance their flavor and aroma we toasted the peppercorns in a small skillet over medium heat for about 2 minutes let them cool then ground them to a fine powder in a spice grinder.

Tagliatelle alla Bolognese,by Academia Barilla adapted by the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Tagliatelle alla Bolognese,10 servings,  Pasta Dough: 2.2 pounds Caputo 00 flour 10 eggs  Sauce: 2 oz Extra Virgin Olive Oil 100% Italiano Academia Barilla 2 ribs celery small dice 2 medium carrots small dice 2 medium yellow onions small dice 1 pound ground pork 1 pound ground beef 2 cups red wine 12 oz tomato paste Sea salt to taste Black pepper to taste   , Bolognese is a thick full-bodied meat sauce that is a staple of northern Italy's Bologna. One of the secrets to this dish is really caramelizing the meat. It adds a distinct richness and depth to the flavor. For the best possible flavor cook the Bolognese one day before you intend to serve it. Bolognese is traditionally served with tagliatelle: a long thin flat egg noodle about  3/4-inch wide.  Pasta Dough: Mound the flour in the center of a clean work surface. Make a well in the middle of the flour add the eggs. Using a fork beat together the eggs and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well. As you incorporate the eggs keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. The dough will come together into a shaggy mass when over half of the flour is incorporated.  Start kneading the dough with both hands primarily using the palms of your hands. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Once the dough comes together in a cohesive mass remove the dough from the work surface using a bench scraper to scrape up all the dough. Lightly flour the board and knead for 5 minutes. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes remembering to dust your work surface with flour when necessary. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and set aside for 20 minutes at room temperature.  Roll out the dough through a pasta machine into very thin sheets (If using an Atlas Pasta Machine roll dough to number 6) then dry the pasta for a few minutes. Cut the dough crosswise into 1/4-inch strips. Place the tagliatelle on a sheet tray that has been dusted with flour cover with a clean dishtowel and set aside until ready to use.  Sauce: In a heavy-bottomed medium pot heat olive oil over medium heat and cook celery carrots and onions and cook until soft and lightly browned about 15 minutes. Add the ground meat and turn the heat up and cook until meat is well caramelized and all fat has been cooked off about 12-15 minutes. Add red wine and cook until completed evaporated. Turn the heat down to medium and add tomato paste. Cook the meat and tomato paste for about 3-5 minutes. Add enough water to cover the meat; season with salt and pepper and cook until the sauce is thick about 60-90 minutes. Adjust seasoning.  In a large pasta pot with plenty of salted boiling water cook drain and saute the pasta with the previously prepared sauce. Serve with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

Whey Maple Milkshake,Recipe courtesy of Scraps,home/recipes/beverages/shakes-smoothies/Whey Maple Milkshake,ounce servings  Learn more about Scraps ,  1 medium apple (remove the seeds but throw in the core and all!)  1/3 cup maple syrup divided 1 cup heavy cream  3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg plus more for garnish 2 pints vanilla ice cream  3/4 cup cheese whey  3/4 cup finely crushed toasted walnuts plus more for garnish   , Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the apple and 1 tablespoon maple syrup. Cook stirring frequently until apples start to brown about 5 minutes. Let cool completely.  In a stand mixer with a whip attachment or in a large bowl with a whisk beat the cream with 1 tablespoon maple syrup and nutmeg until soft peaks form.   In a high speed blender add the apples and any accumulated pan juice ice cream and whey. Blend until completely smooth.  Pour remaining maple syrup into a shallow dish. Put toasted walnuts into another shallow dish. Dip the rim of your glasses into maple syrup then walnuts. Pour in milkshake. Top with whipped cream sprinkle with more walnuts and a little more nutmeg. Serve immediately.   Notes: Whey is the watery remains from the formation of cheese curds or other dairy products. Whey is a byproduct of cheese making.   Save the cheese whey when making ricotta or visit your local cheese shop and ask for some! You can also strain yogurt and use yogurt whey for a similarly tangy flavor. If you can't get whey but need to try this milkshake substitute buttermilk.

Brioche Muffins,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/breakfast/doughnuts-muffins-more/Brioche Muffins,12 muffins,  2- 3/4 cups All-purpose Flour divided 1- 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast  3/4 cup cool water 4 large eggs 2 tablespoons granulated sugar  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter softened    Egg wash 1 large egg 1 tablespoon water  , Place 1- 1/2 cups of the flour the yeast water and eggs into the bowl of a mixer or the bucket of your bread machine. Beat at medium speed (or knead in the bread machine) until smooth. Cover the mixture and let it sit for 45 minutes.   After 45 minutes the sponge will have developed some bubbles but will not have raised much because the mixture is thin. The yeast is getting a jump start.  Add the remaining 1- 3/4 cups flour the sugar and salt.   Beat for 8 to 10 minutes (switch to a dough hook if you're using a mixer) or knead in the bread machine until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and becomes shiny and elastic.   With the mixer or bread machine running add the soft butter 2 tablespoons at a time letting the butter become absorbed before adding the next chunk. Repeat until all of the butter is added. Cover the dough and let it rise for 1 hour. It'll be very soft at this point and should have grown by about a third. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently fold it over several times (use a bench knife to scrape up any bits that stick to the table). Place the dough into a greased bowl cover the bowl and refrigerate it for a minimum of 4 hours and up to about 16 hours. The dough will firm up considerably.  To make individual brioche: Divide the dough into 12 pieces. Take a marble sized piece of dough from each of the 12 pieces and set it aside. Roll each larger bit of dough into a ball; place them in muffin tins. Roll the small pieces into balls. Set them aside and let them rise with the small brioche for 45 minutes to 1 hour.     To bake:  When the dough has risen and is puffy-looking preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease your finger and poke a "belly button" into the center of each individual brioche. Gently place the small marble of dough's into these dents then brush the tops with egg wash. Bake the brioche for 25 to 30 minutes until the centers test 190 degrees F when measured with an instant-read thermometer. Remove the brioche from the oven and cool on a rack before serving.

Frisee Salad with Bacon Egg and Garlic Toasts,David Lebovitz,home/recipes/salads/meat-poultry-seafood/Frisee Salad with Bacon Egg and Garlic Toasts,4 to 6 servings,  Garlic Croutons: 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil plus more if needed 1 clove garlic peeled and slightly crushed 1 1/2 cups (65g) cubes or torn pieces of bread about  3/4 inch (2cm) in size Sea salt or kosher salt  Salad: 8 to 12 new potatoes (12 ounces/ 360g)  Sea salt or kosher salt 2 cups (300g) diced thick-cut bacon smoked or un-smoked 4 teaspoons red wine vinegar 1  1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 5 tablespoons olive oil or neutral-tasting vegetable oil 1 tablespoon water 2 teaspoons peeled and minced garlic 8 cups (150g) loosely packed frisee or escarole leaves 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley or fresh chives Freshly ground black pepper 4 poached eggs or 4 hard-cooked eggs peeled and quartered   , "Salade lyonnaise was the first dish that made me fall in love with French cuisine. Even though the French can be rather territorial about their food ("You want bouillabaisse? Go to Marseille!" "Aïoli? Too much garlic. That's for les Provençaux . . . ") salade lyonnaise is universally beloved across France and beyond. But I have to say if you want the best version you should go to Lyon.  Like good chocolates salade lyonnaise is a confluence of good yet humble ingredients coming together to become something more important than each one could be on its own. The frisee should be crisp and fresh to stand up to the warm ingredients that would turn other salad greens into a mushy pile. The pieces of bacon should be lightly browned not too crunchy so they have a bit of juicy chewiness still left in them. And the fingerling potatoes should be warm when the salad is tossed which helps them soak up the mustardy flavor of the dressing. Poached eggs are added and the runny yolks get stirred into the salad to enrich the vinaigrette. There are other versions that use hard-cooked eggs if you'd rather keep things simple.  –Reprinted with permission from My Paris Kitchen by David Lebovitz copyright © 2014. Published by Ten Speed Press an imprint of Random House LLC.  To make the croutons: heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until it's deeply golden brown; be careful not to burn it. Remove and reserve the garlic then add the bread stirring the cubes in the oil turning them frequently. Add a sprinkle of salt and a dribble more oil if necessary until the bread is brown on all sides about 5 minutes. Set aside until ready to serve.  To make the salad: put the potatoes in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover. Add some salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Decrease the heat to a low boil and cook for 15 minutes until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a sharp knife. (If done in advance cook them slightly less and let them rest in the warm water for up to 45 minutes.)  While the potatoes are cooking fry the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until just starting to crisp. Drain the pieces on a plate lined with paper towels.  In a large salad bowl whisk together the vinegar mustard  3/4 teaspoon of salt the oil water and garlic. (If you like garlic a lot you can chop up the fried garlic clove from making the croutons and add that as well.)  To assemble the salad: slice the potatoes and add them to the bowl along with the bacon and toss gently. Add the frisee parsley and some black pepper. Add the croutons and hard-cooked eggs (if using) and toss very well. Divide among four salad bowls. If using poached eggs slide one on top of each salad and serve.  Variation: Although it's not traditional I sometimes add 2 cups (260g) of crumbled blue cheese to the salad at the last minute omitting the eggs.

Vanilla Shortcrust Dough,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/dough/Vanilla Shortcrust Dough,1 (9- or 9 1/2-inch) tart shell,  1 3/4 cups (6 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar  3/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces 2 large egg yolks 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 to 3 teaspoons water   , To mix the dough using a food processor: Place the flour sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 5 times to blend. Add the cold butter pieces and pulse 6 to 8 times just until the butter is the size of large peas. In the small bowl whisk together the egg yolks vanilla and 1 teaspoon water. Add to the butter mixture then process just until the dough begins to form small clumps 5 to 10 seconds. Do not let the dough form a ball. Test the dough by squeezing a handful of clumps-when you open your hand they should hold together. If they are crumbly and fall apart sprinkle 1 teaspoon water over the dough and pulse several times then test again. Repeat if necessary.  To mix the dough by hand:  Place the flour sugar and salt in the medium bowl and blend well with the whisk. Add the cold butter pieces and toss until they are lightly coated with the flour. Use the pastry blender or your fingertips to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles bread crumbs or crushed crackers. If at any time during this process the butter softens and becomes warm place the bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes before continuing. In the small bowl whisk together the egg yolks vanilla and 1 teaspoon water. Add to the dry ingredients and toss between your fingertips or with a fork 20 to 30 times to evenly distribute the moisture. The dough will still look very crumbly but if the mixture is squeezed in your hand it should hold together. If not sprinkle another teaspoon of water over the top and toss to blend. Repeat if necessary.  Finish the dough:  Turn the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and knead gently 2 or 3 times just to finish bringing it together. Shape it into a disk about 6 inches in diameter. If the dough is still cool to the touch continue on to the next step. If the dough is soft and sticky wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before continuing.  To make the tart shell:  Make sure the dough is cool but malleable. If it has been refrigerated or frozen and is quite hard let it sit on the counter for 10 to 12 minutes before rolling. Place the dough disk between two 14-inch pieces of waxed paper parchment paper or plastic wrap. Roll it into an 11-inch round rotating it (and the paper) clockwise slightly after each roll to create an even round. Remember to roll from the center outward and to lift the rolling pin at the edge to avoid smashing the edge into the paper which will make removing the paper difficult.  As you roll the paper or plastic wrap will get wrinkled into the dough. When this happens peel it off smooth out the wrinkles and lay it back on the dough. Flip the dough over and repeat if necessary with the top piece. Continue to roll flipping and smoothing wrinkles as necessary until the dough is 11 inches across and between  1/8 and  3/4 inch thick. If the dough is soft and sticky transfer it to a baking sheet and chill it for 30 minutes. Peel off the top piece of paper or plastic. Leave the bottom piece attached. Lift the dough by the exposed paper or plastic and flip it over and center it over the tart pan as best you can.  Peel off the paper or plastic. Ease the dough across the bottom of the pan and up the sides pressing it into the corners of the pan with your fingertips. Once the dough is even in the pan fold the excess dough at the edge inward to create a double layer of dough along the wall. Press firmly with your thumbs to fuse the two layers of dough then roll your thumb over the rim of the pan to remove any excess dough there. Refrigerate for 1 hour or freeze for 30 minutes before baking. 
Black-Eyed Pea and Tomato Stew,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/soups-stews/stews/Black-Eyed Pea and Tomato Stew,4 servings,   3/4 cup refined coconut oil 1 large yellow onion quartered lengthwise and thinly sliced 2 jalape&#241;o chilies stemmed halved seeded and thinly sliced 3-ounce piece fresh ginger cut into 4 to 6 chunks 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 tablespoon curry powder 1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder 4 (14 1/2-ounce) cans black-eyed peas drained and rinsed 2 cups water 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes halved Kosher salt and ground black pepper Lime wedges to serve Plantain chips to serve   ,  This Ghanaian dish is traditionally made with red palm oil but we liked more widely available coconut oil instead. We preferred Whole Foods' 365 Everyday Value canned black-eyed peas for their soft creamy texture. Goya brand sold in slightly larger cans also yielded good results but the texture was a bit firmer. Fried plantains are the typical accompaniment to red-red. We liked the simplicity and crunch of store-bought plantain chips. If you like garnish the stew with cilantro leaves and for added spice offer hot sauce at the table.  Don't use unrefined coconut oil which will give the dish a distinct coconut flavor.  In a Durotherm over medium-high (if using gas don't let the flames reach the sides of the pot) heat the coconut oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook stirring occasionally until beginning to brown about 4 minutes. Stir in the jalape&#241;os ginger tomato paste curry powder and chipotle powder. Cook until fragrant about 1 minute.  Add the black-eyed peas and stir well. Stir in the water and soy sauce and bring to a simmer scraping any browned bits from the bottom. Cover and bring to a simmer over medium then cook covered for 20 minutes adjusting heat to ensure a gentle simmer. Uncover and stir in the tomatoes. Cover and return to a simmer on low.  Immediately transfer the pot to its heat-retaining base for 20 minutes. The stew will stay hot for up to 2 hours. When ready to serve uncover remove and discard the ginger chunks then taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve with lime wedges and plantain chips.

Old-Fashioned Dinner Rolls,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Old-Fashioned Dinner Rolls,9 to 10 rolls,  1 small russet potato peeled and quartered  1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast or 1 teaspoon instant yeast  3/4 cup sugar 4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter very soft  1/2 cup warm whole milk (110&deg; to 115&deg;F) 1 large egg at room temperature 2 1/2 cups bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour plus more as needed  1/2 teaspoon salt   , Bakers have been using potatoes (and potato cooking water) for many years. Yeast loves the starchy carbohydrates in potatoes. Their lumpy texture adds not only flavor and moisture but also a chewy softness that is ideal in dinner rolls.   Put the quartered potato in a small saucepan cover with water and set over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes until the tip of a paring knife slides in and out easily. Drain well reserving  3/4 cup of the cooking water. Return the potato to the pan and mash using a potato masher or fork. Set aside to cool to room temperature.  Warm the potato water to 110&deg; to 115&deg;F and pour into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar and whisk by hand to blend. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes or until the yeast is activated and foamy or bubbling. Measure  3/4 cup mashed potatoes and add to the bowl. Add the remaining sugar butter milk and egg and whisk by hand until well blended. Add the flour and salt and knead on low speed for 2 to 3 minutes until the dough comes together. It will seem sticky. With the mixer on low add additional flour a tablespoon at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the speed to medium-low and continue to knead until the dough feels firm dense and springy 5 to 6 minutes. Note: This dough is soft and sticky and will not pull away from the sides completely. Do not overknead or the starch from the potato will break down and make the dough gooey.  Lightly butter or oil a bowl and scrape the dough into it. Lightly coat the surface of the dough with a little butter or oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cotton towel and let the dough rise until doubled in size 45 to 60 minutes (longer if the room is cold).  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press down on the dough firmly to expel some of the air bubbles. Chill covered for at least 2 hours and up to overnight or until the dough is very cold.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Cut the dough into  1/3-cup portions and shape each into a taut round ball. Press the dough into a flattened disk then grab the edges and draw them up into the center pinching all the edges together where they meet. Flip the dough over so the smooth side is up. Cup your hands around the dough and create extra tension by gently pulling the dough downward and tucking it under. Move the dough in a small circle between your cupped hands passing it back and forth and gently tucking around the edges to create extra tension. Position the rolls on the baking sheet about 3 inches apart.  Cover the rolls loosely with plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cotton towel and let rise until almost doubled in size 35 to 40 minutes (longer if the room is cold).  Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F and position an oven rack in the middle of the oven. Bake the rolls for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan and continue to bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer until the rolls are golden brown and their internal temperature registers 200&deg;F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer to a cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.   
Chicken Noodle Soup with Cilantro,GreenPan,home/recipes/soups-stews/meat-poultry/Chicken Noodle Soup with Cilantro,6 servings,  2 chicken breasts 9 cups water 1 large onion (cut in half)  1 large garlic clove (cut in half)  1/2-inch piece fresh ginger (peeled and sliced) 2 celery stalks (chopped)  1 leek (chopped)  4 scallions (finely shredded)  4 ounces egg noodles 4 carrots (peeled and shredded)  1 bunch fresh cilantro Salt and pepper   , Put the chicken breasts and water into a stockpot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer. Add the onion garlic ginger pepper and salt. Continue to simmer for 20 minutes or until the chicken is tender and completely cooked. Remove the chicken the halved onions and garlic. Keep the chicken aside.   Add the celery leek and scallions to the stock.

Smoky Espresso Baby Back Pork Ribs,Charlie Palmer Remington Camp Cooking,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Smoky Espresso Baby Back Pork Ribs,6 servings,  2 racks baby back pork ribs 5 tablespoons Remington Smoky Espresso Pepper Rub Remington Sweet & Spicy Chipotle Molasses BBQ Sauce for serving (optional)   , The secret to these mouth-watering ribs is Charlie Palmer's special rub which combines chocolaty espresso smoky Basque peppers sweet molasses and fiery chili powder to create an intricate well balanced blend of spices.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Cut each rack of ribs in half to create four 6-rib sections. Pat the meat dry with paper towels. Rub both sides of the meat with the Smoky Espresso Pepper Rub.  Cut 8 rectangles of heavy-duty foil each at least 8 inches longer than a rib section. To create four foil packets place each rib section in the center of one foil sheet meat side down. Fold in the vertical ends first and then the horizontal sides crimping as you go so the packet is airtight and lying closely against the ribs. Repeat with the second piece of foil to double wrap and keep the steam inside. This really tenderizes the meat through the cooking process and keeps the rendered fat in keeping the ribs moist.   Place the packets on two sheet pans making sure the ribs are meat side down so the meat will be cooking in the fat-almost braising. Bake in the preheated oven until the meat is very tender about 90 minutes. (You can stick a meat fork straight through the foil into the meat to test if it is fork tender; just don't do this until you are fairly sure they are done or you'll have holes in the foil too early. Also try not to punch through the bottom layer of foil and let the fat leak out.) When the meat is very tender remove the pans from the oven. Let them cool and rest for 20 minutes.   You now have three options:  DIG IN: Carefully open the packets (some blistering steam may still be in there as well as a good accumulation of hot fat at the bottom) transfer the ribs to a cutting board and carve in between the bones. Then try to get the individual ribs to a serving platter before people get grabby.   PACK OUT: Chill the ribs right in their packets place in sealable bags and pack in a cooler for travel to a campsite. Leaving them in the packets reheat on an open-fire grill over low to medium heat. Proceed to "Dig In."  GRILL UP: From either out of the oven or cooled and packed. For some extra-added char flavor: open the packets remove the ribs from the foil and lay meat side down over a hot open-fire grill; don't move them until the surface of the meat crisps about 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and brown the bone side until heated through. Carve and serve.    
Salad of Butter Lettuce and Radishes with Green Goddess Dressing,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/salads/greens-grains-legumes/Salad of Butter Lettuce and Radishes with Green Goddess Dressing,4 servings, Dressing:     1/2 medium ripe avocado peeled pitted and cut into cubes   1/2 cup mayonnaise (low-fat is fine)    3/4 cup sour cream (low-fat is fine)     1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley    1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives    1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh tarragon    2 green onions ends trimmed green and white parts finely minced    1 clove garlic minced    1 teaspoon anchovy paste or to taste    1 tablespoon white wine vinegar or to taste    2 to 3 drops hot pepper sauce or to taste    1 tablespoon water or more if needed      Salad:    1 large or 2 medium heads butter lettuce (enough for 4 cups of bite-size lettuce pieces)   2 ears fresh corn in the husks    4 medium radishes ends trimmed thinly sliced (about  1/2 cup)      , Invented in the 1920s at the historic Palace Hotel in San Francisco this creamy dressing was created in honor of actor George Arliss who was appearing in the stage play The Green Goddess.  The original recipe consisted of mayonnaise anchovies vinegar green onions and herbs.  In this modern update we've included avocado to enrich its silky texture and enhance the lovely green color. This dressing is best made one day in advance to allow the flavors to blend together.  It's delicious over crisp salad greens tomatoes or chilled seafood and is also a lovely dip for crudites.    Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.   For the Dressing:  Combine the avocado mayonnaise sour cream herbs green onions  garlic and anchovy paste in the bowl of a mini food processor; process until very   smooth.      With the processor running add the vinegar and hot pepper sauce; continue processing until fully incorporated.  Again with the processor running add the water to thin the dressing to the desired consistency. (Note:  For crudites dip adding water may be unnecessary.)  Season to taste with salt and white pepper then refrigerate until needed.      For the Salad:  Wash dry and crisp the lettuce; refrigerate until needed.    Trim both ends of the corn. Place in the oven and roast until the kernels are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife about 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove and let cool until just cool enough to handle then remove the husks and silk.  Allow to cool completely.     Use a sharp knife to cut the kernels from the cob.  Discard the cobs and reserve the roasted corn kernels.      Select four large beautiful outer lettuce leaves and set aside.  Tear or cut the remaining lettuce into bite-size pieces.      Combine the lettuce pieces corn and radishes in a medium mixing bowl; toss gently to mix evenly.        Place one of the reserved whole lettuce leaves on each of four chilled salad plates.  Mound the salad mixture onto the leaves dividing it evenly between the plates.      Just before serving taste the dressing and correct the seasoning as needed with additional salt pepper and vinegar.  Drizzle the dressing attractively over the salads and serve immediately.  For a buffet presentation line the outer edge of a chilled medium platter with the whole lettuce leaves and mound the salad mixture in the center.  Serve the dressing on the side and allow your guests to help themselves.

Croque Monsieur Ham & Cheese Sandwich,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/sandwiches/Croque Monsieur Ham & Cheese Sandwich,4 sandwiches,  2 tbsp. butter 2 tbsp. flour 1 1/2 cups milk A pinch each of salt freshly ground pepper nutmeg or more to taste 6 ounces Gruyere cheese grated (about 1 1/2 cups grated)  3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (packed) 8 slices of French or Italian loaf bread 12 ounces ham sliced Dijon mustard   , The word croque comes from the verb croquer or "to crunch". So a Croque-Monsieur roughly translates to "Mister Crunchy".   The feminine version a "Croque Madame" includes a fried egg on top. This classic French bistro sandwich is a great way to use up leftover ham.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.   Make the bechamel sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan on medium/low heat until it just starts to bubble. Add the flour and cook stirring until smooth about 2 minutes. Slowly add the milk whisking continuously cooking until thick. Remove from heat. Add the salt pepper and nutmeg. Stir in the Parmesan and 1/4 cup of the grated Gruyere. Set aside.   Toast bread slices in oven: Lay out the bread slices on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven a few minutes on each side until lightly toasted. For extra flavor you can spread some butter on the bread slices before you toast them if you want. (Alternatively you can assemble the sandwiches as follows in step 4 and grill them on a skillet finishing them in the broiler with the bechamel sauce.)   Build the sandwiches: Lightly brush half of the toasted slices with mustard. Add the ham slices and about 1 cup of the remaining Gruyere cheese. Top with the other toasted bread slices.   Add bechamel more Gruyere: Spoon on the bechamel sauce to the tops of the sandwiches. Sprinkle with the remaining Gruyere cheese.   Broil till bubbly: Place on a broiling pan. Bake in the oven for 5 minutes then turn on the broiler and broil for an additional 3 to 5 minutes until the cheese topping is bubbly and lightly browned.   If you top this sandwich with a fried egg it becomes a Croque Madame.

I am originally from Cleveland Ohio and grew up watching the Browns which means we had plenty of time to cook and eat during games to pass the time and drown our sorrows.  In this recipe I have taken two Midwest classics from my childhood corned beef Rueben and stuffed peppers and combined them into a wonderful and easy to prepare appetizer. Mini sweet peppers are very common in grocery stores now I prefer the multicolored peppers.  This recipe also works great with jalapeno or Anaheim peppers for more heat.   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  To prepare the filling:  Mince or dice the corned beef cheese and sauerkraut and combine into a medium bowl dice the shallot and add.  Stir in the 100 island dressing add enough to bind the filling.    To prepare the peppers:  Fill each pepper with the filling with a small spoon. Stand the peppers up vertically to cook.  Once filled cook for 15 to 20 minutes at 350 degrees F until the peppers are soft and browning and the filling is hot with the cheese melted.   To serve: Let cool transfer stuffed peppers into a tray and serve with 1000 island dressing as a side.    
Perfect Pie Crust,Sur La Table Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/breads/dough/Perfect Pie Crust,1 (9- or 10-inch) pie crust,  1 3/4 (6 3/4 ounces) cups all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes  3/4 to  1/3 cup ice water   , Many bakers are so intimidated by the idea of making flaky pie crust that they either settle for the prepared dough from the grocery store or don't make pie at all. But like all baking pie crust is quite straightforward once you know how the ingredients work together. This recipe can be used to make both sweet and savory pies and tarts. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month. You can also save more time by making the dough in the food processor. Place the flour and cold butter in the processor bowl and pulse to cut the butter into the flour then transfer to a large mixing bowl and proceed with the recipe. Make sure to weigh your ingredients for best results.  To make the dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring with the fork.  Gather the clumps of dough together on the work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.

The Crunchy Creamy Carrot Salad,Samah Dada,home/recipes/salads/fruit-vegetable/The Crunchy Creamy Carrot Salad, 3-4, Carrots:   1 pound carrots  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  1 teaspoon ground cumin  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  Red pepper flakes to taste     Salad:   3 tablespoons sesame seeds  8 ounces fresh baby arugula  1 avocado sliced  1 cup grape tomatoes halved  1 / 4 cup unsalted toasted sliced almonds (see Note)     Za'atar & Lemon Vinaigrette:   1 / 4 cup fresh lemon juice  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  2 teaspoons honey  1 teaspoon za'atar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste Red pepper flakes   , There are some people who love greens so much they could just eat them straight up with a drizzle of olive oil and lemon juice. I am not one of those people. What excites me most about a bowl of leaves isn't necessarily the actual leaves but rather what's on top of them. This is probably why I (a) lose my cool (b) lose my dignity and (c) lose some money when I order a salad or come anywhere near a salad bar. I always seem to black out and forget that toppings are extra.  Anyway the great thing about varying toppings for salads is that they add different flavors and textures making the greens a lot more interesting to eat. In this case it's the tender cumin-roasted carrots working the magic alongside crunchy almonds and sesame seeds creamy avocado and a bright lemon vinaigrette. In short this salad is definitely extra.   Roast the carrots: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.   Halve or quarter the carrots lengthwise (depending on how thick they are) and put them in a large bowl. Add the olive oil cumin salt and black pepper and red pepper flakes and toss to coat. Transfer the carrots to the lined baking sheet and roast them tossing halfway through for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are tender and slightly charred but still have a crisp bite to them.   While the carrots are roasting toast the sesame seeds: Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot add the sesame seeds. Toast tossing until the sesame seeds turn golden and have a nutty aroma 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a small plate to cool.  Make the Za'atar & Lemon Vinaigrette: In a small bowl combine the lemon juice olive oil honey and za'atar and whisk to combine. Season to taste with salt black pepper and red pepper flakes.   Make the salad: In a large bowl combine the arugula avocado slices grape tomatoes most of the toasted sesame seeds and most of the almonds with the salad dressing and toss to combine. Arrange the roasted carrots on top of the salad or slice them into 3-inch lengths and mix them into the salad. (Add as much or as little as you'd like; if there's extra serve it as a side dish.) Sprinkle the remaining sesame seeds and almonds on top before serving.  Note: If you have some untoasted sliced almonds at home you can dry-toast them yourself using the same method as we do for the sesame seeds.  Recipe from DADA EATS LOVE TO COOK IT.

Guinness Ice Cream with Chocolate Bacon Bits,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Guinness Ice Cream with Chocolate Bacon Bits,1 quart,  12 ounces Guinness Stout or other dark stout beer 2 cups heavy cream 2 cups whole milk  3/4 cup sugar 1 vanilla bean split lengthwise 6 large egg yolks 1 pound thick-cut applewood smoked bacon 1 pound semisweet chocolate chopped   , Beer-flavored ice cream? This unexpected yet amazing dessert takes advantage of the deep caramel notes in the stout to create a frozen treat full of complex flavors. The sprinkling of chocolate-covered bacon pieces pushes this unique sweet treat over the top.  To prepare the ice cream pour the Guinness in a large saucepan and heat over medium-high heat. Simmer the stout until reduced to 4 ounces and reaches a syrupy consistency about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely.  Combine cream milk and sugar in another large saucepan. Using a sharp paring knife cut a lengthwise slit in the vanilla bean. Using the back edge of the knife scrape the vanilla bean seeds out of the pod and into milk mixture along with the pod itself. Heat milk mixture over medium heat until it boils then remove immediately from heat.  Prepare a large mixing bowl with an ice-water bath. In a medium mixing bowl whisk the egg yolks until thick and pale yellow in color. Rapidly whisk 1 cup of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks. Gradually add the egg mixture in a slow steady stream back into the hot cream while whisking constantly. Cook egg mixture over medium-low heat stirring occasionally until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon about 6 to 8 minutes. Add the reduced stout to the thickened egg mixture whisking well until to blend. Transfer the ice cream base to a heatproof medium mixing bowl and place inside ice-water bath. Stir ice cream base often and cool completely. Cover and refrigerate ice cream base for at least 4 hours or until cold.  Pour cold ice cream base into the bowl of an ice cream machine and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. Because of the stout the ice cream will only reach a soft-serve consistency. Remove ice cream from machine cover and freeze until ready to use.  To prepare chocolate-covered bacon bits preheat oven to 400 degrees and place a rack in the center. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange bacon strips on prepared baking sheet leaving 1 inch of space around each piece. Place a second rimmed sheet directly on top of the bacon and weigh down baking sheet with a heavy ovenproof skillet. Transfer to preheated oven and cook bacon until well browned but still pliable about 25 to 30 minutes.  While the bacon cooks fill the bottom of a double boiler with 2 inches water and heat over medium-low heat until simmering. Place chocolate in the top of a double boiler and set over the simmering water. Heat gently stirring often until completely melted. Keep warm over low heat.  Once the bacon is cooked transfer the slices to a heatproof wire rack set over another rimmed baking sheet spacing the bacon at least 1 inch apart on all sides. Using a silicone pastry brush coat one side of each bacon piece with melted chocolate. Transfer pan with bacon to the refrigerator for 8 to 10 minutes to let chocolate set. Remove pan from refrigerator and carefully flip the bacon pieces. Coat the second side of the bacon with melted chocolate and return pan to refrigerator for another 8 to 10 minutes until ready to use.  To serve use a sharp chef's knife to chop the coated bacon into  1/2-inch pieces. Scoop ice cream into chilled bowls sprinkle chopped bacon over ice cream and serve immediately.

Leek Parmesan and Ham Quiche,Sur La Table Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/breakfast/egg-dishes/Leek Parmesan and Ham Quiche,8 servings,  Quiche Filling: 1 recipe Flaky Pie Dough (recipe follows) 1 tablespoon canola or vegetable oil 2 tablespoons ( 3/4 stick) unsalted butter 2 medium leeks white and light green parts only cut into 1/8-inch thick rounds  3/4 cup heavy cream  3/4 cup whole milk 3 large eggs 1 teaspoon kosher salt  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces ham (or bacon if preferred) cut into  3/4-inch pieces 4 ounces grated Parmesan cheese 4 tablespoons chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley  Flaky Pie Dough: 1 stick cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces 3 to 4 tablespoons cold water 1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar (omit for a savory crust)  3/4 teaspoon salt   , Quiche is the perfect choice for brunch since you can serve it warm or room temperature. Make the pie dough a few days in advance and chill or you can make it weeks in advance and freeze it. The quiche can even be baked without a crust if you wish. Just butter a tart pan and sprinkle with additional grated Parmesan cheese add filling ingredients and pour custard over the top. Bake in a water bath until custard sets about 1 hour.  To prepare crust for baking: preheat oven to 375 degrees. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until the circle measures 14 inches wide and 1/8 inch thick. Starting at one edge roll the dough around the rolling pin and lay it gently into a 9-inch quiche or tart pan with 2-inch sides. Unroll the dough and adjust as need so dough circle is centered over the pan. Carefully lift the edges of the dough and allow it to fall into the pan pressing the dough gently into the corners. Trim excess dough flush to the top of the pan reserving excess dough. Chill unbaked crust for at least 30 minutes before baking.   To bake quiche crust: line the chilled crust with aluminum foil pressing the foil firmly into the corners. Fill the pan with pie weights making sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan. Bake the shell for 20 to 22 minutes or until the foil pulls easily away from the dough. Remove the pan from the oven and carefully lift out the foil and weights from the shell setting them aside to cool. Return the pan to the oven and continue baking the crust for another 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and check for cracks in the crust.  Patch cracks as needed with a small amount of reserved dough. Return the pan to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer until crust golden brown. Transfer pan to a rack and cool crust slightly. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add leeks and cook stirring occasionally until softened about 7 to 9 minutes. With a slotted spoon transfer leeks to a medium mixing bowl and allow to cool.   In a large mixing bowl whisk together heavy cream milk and eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.  Scatter leeks chopped ham Parmesan cheese and parsley across the bottom of the crust. Carefully pour the cream mixture into the crust and gently stir to evenly distribute the filling ingredients.   Set the quiche pan on a baking sheet and place in preheated oven. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until a paring knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let quiche cool for 10 minutes and serve warm or allow quiche to cool completely and serve at room temperature.  Flaky Pie Dough:Place the butter pieces in a bowl or on a plate and freeze for at least 20 minutes. Refrigerate the water in a small measuring cup until needed.  Mix the dough: Place the flour sugar and salt in the bowl of the food processor. Process for 10 seconds to blend the ingredients. Add the frozen butter pieces and pulse 6 to 10 times (in 1-second bursts) until the butter and flour mixture looks like crushed crackers and peas.  Immediately transfer the butter-flour mixture to the large bowl. Sprinkle a tablespoon of the cold water over the mixture and fluff it in then add another and another until 3 tablespoons have been added. Continue to fluff and stir 10 or 12 times. It will not be a cohesive dough at this point but a bowl of shaggy crumbs and clumps of dough. Before bringing the dough together you need to test it for the correct moisture content. Take a handful of the mixture and squeeze firmly. Open your hand. If the clump falls apart and looks dry remove any large moist clumps from the bow

Sous Vide Smoked Brisket,Courtesy of Anova,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Sous Vide Smoked Brisket,10 servings,  1 flat- or point-cut brisket about 5 pounds 2 oz. coarsely ground black peppercorns (about  1/3-cup)  2  3/4 oz. kosher salt (about  3/4-cup)   3/4 tsp. liquid smoke (optional)   3/4 oz. pink salt (optional)  Dill pickles sliced yellow onion and white bread for serving   , Start by grinding a half cup of whole black peppercorns using a burr grinder a pepper mill or a food processor. You're looking for a coarse grind but not so coarse that identifiable peppercorns remain.  Combine the pepper with  3/4-cup of kosher salt and rub it evenly over every surface of the brisket. If you're using pink salt add 1 tablespoon of pink salt (about 10 grams) to the rub before applying it.  Chances are your brisket will be too large to fit in a single vacuum or resealable zipper locking bag. Split it in half crosswise to allow it to fit.  Place the brisket inside a vacuum sealer or resealable zipper locking bag. (Fold over the top while you add the meat so that no juices get on the edge of the bag which can weaken the seal.) Add a half teaspoon of liquid smoke and to the bag if you're using the liquid smoke method. Don't worry much about distributing the liquid smoke evenly over the beef; it'll spread around during cooking no matter where you add it. Seal the bag using a vacuum sealer. If using pink salt let the beef rest for three to four hours in the refrigerator before proceeding.  Set the temperature on your Precision Cooker to 155 degrees F for traditionally moist and tender brisket or for 135 degrees F for brisket that has a meatier more steak-like texture.  Add brisket to water bath and cover it with a lid aluminum foil or table tennis balls. Cook for 24 to 36 hours at 155 degrees F or 36 to 72 hours at 135 degrees F.  When the brisket has finished cooking remove from bags and carefully blot dry with paper towels. (Liquid from bags can be added to your favorite barbecue sauce and simmered down to provide extra flavor.) Allow cooked brisket to cool at least to room temperature before proceeding (an ice bath can speed up this process). Brisket can be stored in the refrigerator at this stage for up to 1 week before finishing.  Finishing steps – smoker: Light  1/2 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively set half the burners on a gas grill to medium-high heat cover and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate. Rub reserved salt and pepper mixture into surface of brisket and then place it on cooler side of grill.  Add 4 to 5 hardwood chunks to hotter side of grill. Cover and cook adding a few pieces of wood and coals as necessary and maintaining the air intake valves to try and keep the cooker hovering at around 275- to 300 degrees F at all times. Add 2 to 3 wood chunks twice during cooking.  Keep cooking until the brisket has achieved a deep dark bark about 3 hours.  Transfer brisket to a cutting board and tent with foil. Allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice against the grain into thin strips and serve.  Finishing steps – oven:Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300 degrees F. If your oven has a convection setting turn it on and adjust heat to 275 degrees F instead. Rub reserved salt and pepper mixture into surface of brisket and place them on a foil-rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack placed in it.  Cook until the exterior achieves a dark mahogany bark about 2 hours.  Transfer brisket to a cutting board and tent with foil. Allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice against the grain into thin strips and serve.  
Earl Grey Shortbread Coins,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Earl Grey Shortbread Coins,36 cookies,   3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar 1 tablespoon ( 3/4 ounce) good quality Earl Grey tea leaves 1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces  3/4 cup (3 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour plus additional 3 tablespoons (if making without cocoa)  1/8 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons sanding or decorator's sugar (optional) 3 tablespoons ( 3/4 ounce) unsweetened cocoa powder either Dutch-process or natural (optional)   , Delicately nubby from the texture of Earl Grey tea leaves these cookies are strictly for adults. For the best flavor use top-quality bulk tea. Serve the cookies with a cup of the tea or any time you want a sophisticated cookie. Without tea leaves they are a wonderful shortbread cookie that even children will love.   For a chocolaty variation add unsweetened cocoa powder. The dough can also be rolled out and cut into shapes as directed at the end of the recipe.  Place the granulated sugar and tea leaves in the bowl of the food processor and grind for 1 minute or until the leaves are very finely chopped. Add the butter flour cocoa (optional) and salt and process for about 45 seconds. Scrape down the bowl and break up any large clumps with the spatula. Process for another 15 to 30 seconds until the dough looks uniformly dark and forms large shaggy clumps. Dump the dough out onto a work surface and knead gently several times just to bring it together.  Squeeze the dough into a log about 12 inches long and about 1 inch in diameter and gently roll it back and forth until smooth. Don't add flour if the dough is sticky-simply refrigerate the dough for 15 or 20 minutes to firm up the butter then try again.  If you like sprinkle the sanding sugar on the work surface alongside the log and gently roll the log in the sugar turning to coat evenly. Cut a piece of plastic wrap several inches longer than the log and center the log at one long edge of the wrap. Roll the log into the wrap so it is tightly bound by the plastic. Twist the ends of the wrap to secure the log and help to create a rounded shape. You can use a cardboard paper towel roll to keep the roll of dough nicely rounded during storage. Just slit the cardboard lengthwise and slip the log inside it to help keep the rounded shape. Refrigerate for 2 hours.  Preheat the oven to 300&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper.  Remove the cardboard and plastic wrap from the dough log and use a thin knife to slice it into &#8540;-inch-thick rounds. Place about 18 cookies 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Bake rotating the sheet halfway through the baking time for 30 minutes or until the cookies are cooked through and look dry on top. (It's difficult to tell when dark chocolate cookies are done. This is when an oven thermometer and a timer are your best friends in the kitchen.) Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack and let them cool completely.  Storing: Keep the cooled cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.  Cutout Shortbread Cookies: Shape the prepared dough into a flat disk wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes to chill slightly. Lightly dust your work surface and the top of the dough with flour and roll the dough into a 10 3/4-inch circle about 3/8" thick. Alternatively roll the dough between two sheets of parchment or wax paper.   Chill the dough again for 30 minutes. Cut into shapes using the cookie cutter of your choice and transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets.   To reroll scraps brush any flour from the top and bottom of the dough knead gently to bring together and roll again. If the dough is sticky chill it for 15 to 20 minutes and try again.   Once all the cookies are cut transfer the baking sheets to the refrigerator and chill the cutout cookies for 30 minutes then bake and store as directed.   Note: The size of your cookie cutter will affect the yield of the recipe you may get only 1 to 2 dozen cookies.   
Lavender Macarons with Dark Chocolate Ganache,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Lavender Macarons with Dark Chocolate Ganache,35 sandwich cookies,  7 ounces powdered sugar 4 ounces almond flour or meal 4 large egg whites room temperature 3- 1/2 ounces granulated sugar Pinch of cream of tartar 1 teaspoon pure lavender extract  3/4 teaspoon lavender food coloring (optional)  Dark chocolate ganache (recipe follows)   Dark Chocolate Ganache: Yields 1 cup   6 ounces heavy cream 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate finely chopped  1 ounce (2 tablespoons) unsalted butter softened 1 tablespoon cognac or brandy (optional)    , Preheat oven to 375 degrees if using double-baking sheet cooking method. Otherwise pre-heat oven to 325 degrees if using single baking sheet cooking method.   Prepare the baking sheets with the parchment paper macaron templates-line baking sheets with silicone mats and top with parchment paper templates.  In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade pulse the powdered sugar with the almond flour until a fine powder is formed. Sift mixture four times. Set aside.   To make the meringue: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment whisk whites on medium speed until foamy. Gradually add granulated sugar. Once all sugar is incorporated and the mixture is thick add the cream of tartar. Scrape down sides of bowl add lavender extract and food coloring.  Increase mixing speed to high whisking until stiff glossy peaks form.   To complete the macaronnage step: Sift the almond flour mixture one-third at a time over the egg white mixture and fold using a large spatula until mixture is smooth and shiny. Once all the almond flour mixture is incorporated check for the correct consistency as the batter should be nicely firm have a glossy shine and drip slowly from the spatula.   Transfer batter to a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip (#12) and pipe 1 1/3-inch rounds on parchment-lined baking sheets. Gently tap the bottom of each sheet on work surface to release trapped air. Let stand at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes. Check for a slight crust to form on the macaron. The macarons should not stick to your finger when lightly touched.   If using the double baking sheet cooking method place an empty baking sheet underneath the baking tray with the piped macarons.   Bake one sheet at a time rotating halfway through until macarons are crisp and firm about 10 to 15 minutes. If the macarons are still soft inside lower oven to 300 degrees cover with aluminum foil and bake for a few more minutes. If the top of the macarons look crinkled your oven temperature may be too hot.  Let macarons cool on baking sheets for 2 to 3 minutes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before filling with chocolate ganache.  Dark Chocolate Ganache:  In a small saucepan heat cream over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Place chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and pour hot cream over the chocolate. Let stand for 1 minute.   Slowly stir chocolate mixture with a silicone spatula to combine. Add butter and whisk mixture until smooth. Add cognac or brandy if desired. Let cool stirring every 10 minutes. Once ganache cools use a small offset spatula and gently spread between two macarons.   
Flaky Apple Pinwheels,Knives Cooks Love:Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Sarah Jay photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/Flaky Apple Pinwheels,4 servings,  2 medium apples (12 ounces) such as Braeburn Gala or Rome  3/4cup sugar  3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Scant 1⁄8 teaspoon nutmeg preferably freshly ground Pinch of kosher salt 1 sheet frozen puff pastry (9 ounces) thawed at room temperature for 45 minutes (keep refrigerated until ready to use) 1 tablespoon unsalted butter cut into small pieces 1 large egg Turbinado sugar or another coarse sugar for sprinkling (optional)   , Simple and lovely on their own these individual pastries are even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che. They're best when warm from the oven so if it helps with timing you can assemble them ahead and refrigerate for a couple of hours before baking (don't brush with egg until the last minute though). Slicing the apples is a breeze; try to aim for uniform thickness so they cook evenly.  Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F. Line a baking sheet  with parchment paper. Peel the apples and cut them into  3/4-inch-thick slices. Put the apples in a medium bowl. Sprinkle with the sugar cinnamon nutmeg and salt and toss until evenly coated.  On a lightly floured surface gently unfold the puff pastry and roll it out to a 12-inch square (use a ruler; don't guesstimate). Cut it into four 6-inch squares. Put the squares on the lined baking sheet.  Pour a little water in a small dish. Set a mound of apples in the center of each pastry square distributing them evenly. Drop the butter pieces evenly over the apples. Moisten the four corners of one of the pastry squares with the water. Lift up and join the corners together in the center first squeezing them firmly and then giving a good hard twist (don't be shy; firm pressure is essential or the pinwheels may open during baking). Repeat with the other three squares.  Lightly beat the egg in a small dish. Brush the pastries with the egg; be sure to coat all surfaces including the sides and the center knob. Sprinkle each pastry with a little turbinado sugar. Bake until the pinwheels are deep golden on top and bottom (lift one up to check) about 25 minutes. Set the pan on a rack for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

Sous Vide Egg Bites,ChefSteps,home/recipes/breakfast/egg-dishes/Sous Vide Egg Bites,6 egg bites,  300 g Eggs about 6 large 300 g Heavy cream and/or cottage cheese 3 g Salt plus more to taste Cherry tomatoes optional as needed Pine nuts optional as needed Finishing oil such as high-quality extra virgin olive oil optional as needed Basil fresh leaves optional as needed Black pepper optional as needed   , This recipe was designed for use with the Joule Sous Vide by Chef Steps.  Heat Joule to185  degrees F / 85  degrees C: NOTE: Remember the water in your pot will get hot enough to cook your food-treat your work surface accordingly! Place a trivet beneath the pot to help protect your countertop or use whatever precautions you normally would when exposing your counter to a dish pot or pan you just removed from the oven or stove.  Blend your base: Crack eggs into the pitcher of your blender (or a bowl if you are using an immersion blender). Then add the cottage cheese heavy cream or mixture of both and sprinkle in the salt. Blend at medium-high speed until silky smooth.  Jar that base up: Pour the egg base into the jars filling them to the bottom notch of the jar opening. Place a lid on each mason jar and twist the lid until it's closed but still possible to open with your fingertips. This allows air to escape from the jars when they're submerged in water. If the jars are closed too tightly the trapped air will press against the glass and could crack or break the jars. Here's our foolproof way to master the art of closing jars "fingertip tight": Place the lid on top of the jar then twist the band to tighten using just your fingertips. When you begin to feel resistance twist once in the opposite direction to loosen then once more in the original direction to tighten.  Cook!: Cook those silky smooth treats for 25 minutes.  Top those bites with the good stuff (optional): You sure can eat these eggies plain-and they will be delicious-but we like to top our bites with tomatoes basil and pine nuts for a flavorful fresh counterpart to the silky eggs. Slice the cherry tomatoes into quarters or halves. In a little bowl combine the sliced tomatoes with pine nuts drizzle them with olive oil and mix. Spoon the mixture over each of your egg bites and garnish with a few basil leaves salt and pepper.  Serve!: Dig into those warm tender eggs right away or stick 'em in the fridge to have perfect breakfasts all week long.

Scrappy Turkey Burgers,Recipe courtesy of Scraps,home/recipes/sandwiches/Scrappy Turkey Burgers,6 burgers  Learn more about Scraps ,  Slaw and Toppings:  1/2 head green cabbage thinly sliced 1 medium tart apple coarsely grated   3/4 cup cheese whey  1/2 cup prepared mayonnaise 2 tablespoons Dijon or whole grain mustard 1 tablespoon maple syrup Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper  Burgers: 1 tablespoon unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil  2 cups assorted finely chopped vegetables (onions mushrooms greens carrots and other root vegetables zucchini etc.) 1 clove garlic grated 1 pound ground turkey (or your favorite ground meat) 1 cup cooked beans drained and smashed (any type) Vegetable oil for greasing grill  6 ounces sharp cheddar cheese thinly sliced or grated  6 burger buns    , Make the slaw: In a large bowl add cabbage apple and whey. Stir to combine. Let slaw sit at room temperature while you make the burgers.   Make the sauce: In a small bowl stir together mayonnaise mustard and maple syrup. Season with salt and pepper. Set sauce aside.   Make the burgers: Heat butter (or oil) in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetables. Season with salt and pepper and cook stirring frequently until vegetables are soft and start to brown. Add garlic cook for about 30 more seconds. Remove from heat and let cool completely.   In a large bowl add cooked vegetables turkey and beans. Season with more salt and pepper. Using your hands or a spatula mash everything together until just combined (don't overmix). Form into 6 burger patties.  Grill the burgers: Clean grill grates and rub grates with a cloth dipped in vegetable oil. Light grill to medium-high heat. Alternately heat an indoor grill pan or cast iron skillet. Grill burgers for about 4 minutes per side until internal temperature when tested with a thermometer reaches 165 degrees F. When burgers are almost done top with cheese and cover to allow cheese to melt. Remove from grill keep warm.  Put burger buns cut side down on grill until lightly toasted. Assemble burgers in buns topped with slaw and sauce.   Notes: Joel and Sally used a combination of onions mushrooms Swiss chard carrots and white beans in their burger. They topped it with sharp Vermont cheddar of course!  This hybrid meat and veggie burger is a "gateway" to the world of veggie burgers. The key to keeping these burgers together are the mashed beans. Play around with the ratio of vegetables to meat to beans. Or opt for no meat for a veggie option.   Try wrapping your burger in a collard chard lettuce or cabbage leaf like Sally!   Note on whey:  Whey is the watery remains from the formation of cheese curds or other dairy products. Whey is a byproduct of cheese making. Save the cheese whey when making ricotta or visit your local cheese shop and ask for some! You can also strain plain yogurt and use yogurt whey for a similarly tangy flavor. If you can't get whey but need to try this slaw substitute buttermilk.

My mother's simple recipe included a whole cut-up chicken with water a dash of flour and a bit of cream to finish. I have added white wine and mushrooms to make the dish a bit more sophisticated and used chicken thighs which are the best part of the chicken (1 1/2 thighs per person should be a generous serving for a main course). A sprinking of chopped tarragon at the end makes it more special but it is optional. Most of the time my mother served hers with rice pilaf.  Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the chicken thighs to the pan in one layer and brown over high heat for about 2 1/2 minutes on each side.  Add the mushrooms to the pan and sprinkle on the flour. Turn the chicken pieces with tongs so the flour is dispersed evenly. Stir in the wine and water and mix well. Bring to a boil and add the salt and pepper. Cover reduce the heat and cook gently for 25 minutes.  Add the cream bring to a boil and boil uncovered for about 1 minute.  Serve sprinkled with the chopped tarragon if desired.

Pappardelle Pasta Dough,Ethan Stowell,home/recipes/breads/dough/Pappardelle Pasta Dough,4 servings,  3 cups Italian "00" flour 3 eggs 3 egg yolks Pinch salt 2 tablespoons water 1 tablespoon olive oil   , Freshly made pasta puts the dried variety to shame. This easy-to-follow recipe will have you making your own noodles at home in no time.  Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer like the Kenwood Chef Kitchen Machine fitted with a dough hook. Mix on a low speed until the dough comes together into a ball. Continue to mix for about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove dough from the bowl wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature for at least an hour.   Attach a pasta roller attachment to your stand mixer.   Once the dough has rested remove the plastic and divide it into two or four equal parts. Press the dough down with your fingertips to make a rectangle shape as thin as you can. Turn the pasta roller setting to its thickest setting. Set the machine to a low speed and feed the pasta through the roller until it is all the way through. Turn the speed up to its next highest setting and repeat the process cycling up through the speeds until you have a thin sheet of dough. If the pasta gets sticky at all sprinkle a little flour on it and continue.   Once you have one long sheet of pasta cut it into 10-12-inch sheets. Then cut those sheets lengthwise into 1-inch thick noodles. Lightly dust the pasta with flour and lay out on the cookie sheet until you plan on cooking it. Repeat with the remaining dough.   Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt. Add the pasta and stir so it does not stick together. Cook uncovered at a rolling boil stirring occasionally for about 6-7 minutes or until al dente. Strain and mix with your sauce.    
Summer Berry Galette,Sur La Table & Renee Behnke Memorable Recipes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Summer Berry Galette,8 to 12 servings,  6 cups (about 1 1/2 pounds) blackberries or a mix of blackberries blueberries and raspberries  3/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon freshly grated or ground nutmeg  Pastry Dough:  1/2 cup unsalted butter 1 cup all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon salt 3 to 4 tablespoons cold water  Egg Wash: 1 egg 1 teaspoon water   , Vibrant and tart summer berries wrapped up in a free form buttery pastry? Don’t forget the ice cream!  Many types of berries make outstanding pies but strawberries don't hold up nearly as well as blackberries blueberries and other berry options.  Frozen berries can be used off-season but allow them to thaw in advance and drain off excess liquid before using. You can even use sliced apples pears or other fruit.  For the pastry dough: Cut the butter into small cubes and freeze for 5 minutes. Combine the butter flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Process for 10 to 15 seconds until the butter is finely chopped. Add 3 tablespoons of the water and pulse for another 10 seconds or until the mixture looks like cornmeal.   Pinch some of the dough between your fingers; it should hold together not feel crumbly or dusty. If necessary add more water a teaspoon at a time pulsing once or twice after each addition.   Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface. Gather about one-quarter of the dough into a small pile and use the heel of your hand to push the dough away from you two or three times which helps thoroughly blend the butter and flour for a flakier crust. Don't overwork the dough or it will produce a tough crust.   Repeat with the remaining dough. Use a pastry scraper to gather the dough and then form it into a disk about 5 inches across. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.  For the berry filling: Combine the berries  3/4 cup of the sugar the flour tapioca lemon juice cinnamon and nutmeg in a large bowl. Toss very gently to evenly coat the berries in the sugar mixture being careful not to crush the berries.  Assemble the galette: Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 14-inch circle. Set it on the baking sheet and spoon the berries into the center spreading them out slightly and leaving a 2 1/2-inch border bare. Fold in the dough edges to partly cover the filling pleating 4 or 5 times around the perimeter.  For the egg wash:  Beat the egg in a small bowl until frothy then beat in the water. Lightly brush the egg wash on the dough and sprinkle with the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar.  Bake the galette for 30 to 40 minutes or until crust is a light golden brown. Serve with vanilla ice cream while warm.

Salmon Dill Linguine,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Salmon Dill Linguine,4 servings,  Kosher salt 1 recipe Homemade Pasta Dough (see below) cut into  3/4-inch ribbons 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium shallot peeled and minced  1/2 pound smoked salmon cut into  1/2-inch cubes   3/4 cup heavy whipping cream  3/4 cup water  3/4 cup capers drained and rinsed 1 teaspoon lemon zest 2 tablespoon lemon juice more according to taste Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons minced dill   Homemade Pasta Dough Yields 4 servings. If you can find Italian "00" flour use it to make very delicate yet chewy pasta. If not all-purpose flour works really well.   2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour or "00" flour plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon kosher salt 4 large eggs 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil    , Linguine is sometimes referred to as Trenette pasta. These narrow  3/4-inch wide long ribbons have a broad surface for holding sauce and are well-suited to cream based sauces.  To make the homemade pasta: Place flour and salt in a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Make a "well" in the center of the flour mixture and add eggs and oil. Using your fingers blend the eggs into the flour mixture stirring the flour in from the sides of the well and working outwards.   When the pasta dough is thoroughly mixed turn it out on a lightly floured work surface. Knead dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky adding small amounts of flour as needed about 5 minutes. Gather the dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes at room temperature.  To roll dough secure a pasta machine to the edge of a long countertop. Using a bench scraper cut the dough into thirds. Keep extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with one piece. Flatten the piece of dough into a rough rectangle so that it will fit inside the width of the pasta machine. Place the rollers on the widest setting and roll the dough through the machine catching it with one hand as you roll with the other. Take the dough and fold into thirds towards the center of the dough. Turn the dough so one open end faces the machine and roll it through on the widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting. Continue rolling the pasta through the machine without folding adjusting the rollers to the next smallest setting each time until the desired thickness is reached. If the pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.   Cut sheets to  3/4 inch wide long ribbons toss with flour and set aside covered with a clean kitchen towel. The pasta can be cooked immediately or covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to an hour before use.    To cook pasta: Heat a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add enough kosher salt to season the water to taste like sea water. While salted water boils vigorously add linguine and stir immediately to prevent pasta from sticking together. Boil until pasta is al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta water and drain pasta through a colander.   To prepare pasta sauce: Place a large skillet on the stove over medium heat and add oil. When the oil is shimmering add the shallot and cook until tender about 2 minutes. Add the smoked salmon and continue to cook until the salmon is warmed through 1 to 2 minutes.   Pour in the cream and water and allow to bubble. Add the capers and cook until the sauce thickens about 3 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest and juice and then add the cooked linguine to the skillet and toss until thoroughly combined. If the sauce is too thick add some of the reserved pasta water to thin the sauce. Remove the skillet from the heat taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.   To serve: Divide the pasta between 4 warmed pasta bowls sprinkle with minced dill and serve immediately.

Flourless Soy Sauce Brownies,Hetty McKinnon,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Flourless Soy Sauce Brownies,12-16,  1 stick (8 tablespoons / 115 g) unsalted butter 1 cup (175 g) semisweet or dark chocolate bits 1 cup (100 g) almond meal 3 tablespoons cocoa powder  1/2 teaspoon baking powder 3 large eggs 1 cup (185 g) brown sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3–4 teaspoons tamari or gluten-free soy sauce     Substitute    Tamari or soy sauce: 1  1/2 tablespoons Vegemite or 2 teaspoons sea salt flakes Almond meal: hazelnut meal or ground walnuts   , A few years ago I posted a recipe for Vegemite brownies on my website which raised some eyebrows. Yes the use of this yeasty uber-umami sandwich spread in a brownie is surprising but it brings a complex depth of flavor that is quite unique. These soy sauce brownies are of a similar ilk—where salt is widely used to amplify the "chocolatey" flavors in desserts soy sauce brings a rich caramel glow. The taste very much resembles salted caramel. This brownie is gluten free by way of nutty almond meal and a gluten-free soy sauce. There are many different gluten-free soy sauces on the market and they all work well in this recipe.   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease and line a 9-inch (22.5 cm) square baking pan.  Place the butter and chocolate in a large glass bowl (one that is completely dry and clean) and set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the base of the bowl touch the water). Leave until melted then whisk until smooth. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes.  In another bowl whisk together the almond meal cocoa powder and baking powder.  In a third bowl whisk together the eggs brown sugar vanilla extract and soy sauce.  Slowly whisk the egg mixture into the cooled chocolate mixture until well combined. Fold in the dry ingredients.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25 minutes. Remove and allow to cool completely in the pan (I like to leave it in the fridge overnight which makes it easier to handle). Cut into 12–16 pieces (depending on how big you like them). Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week.  To Asia With Love by Hetty McKinnon copyright &#169; 2021.

Add the egg salt and pepper.  Heat a griddle nonstick or cast-iron skillet and coat with a thin film of vegetable oil. Take about 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture in the palm of your hand and flatten as best you can. Place the potato mixture on the griddle flatten with a large spatula and fry for a few minutes until golden brown. Flip the pancake over and brown the other side. Remove to paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining mixture adding more oil as necessary giving it time to get hot between batches.  Serve immediately.  Note: You can also freeze the potato pancakes on cookie sheets and transfer to a freezer bag once solid.  When ready to serve arrange them on a cookie sheet and crisp in an oven heated to 350 degrees F for about 15 -20 minutes.  Variation: If you want a more traditional and thicker pancake you can add an extra egg plus  1/3 cup of matzah meal to the batter.

Peanut Butter Ice Cream Sandwiches,Kristan Raines,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Peanut Butter Ice Cream Sandwiches, sandwhiches,  1 cup creamy peanut butter  3/4 cup + 2 tbsp. all-purpose flour  1/2 cup brown sugar packed   1/2 tsp baking powder 1 large egg  3/4 tsp sea salt 1  1/2 tsp vanilla extract 2 pints ice cream of choice 1 cup chocolate chips 2  1/2 tbsp. coconut oil   , Heat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper.  Add the peanut butter flour brown sugar baking powder egg salt and vanilla in a medium bowl and mix until well combined. Divide the dough into 14 equal rounds (33g each). Place the rounds on the prepared baking sheet and slightly flatten each one until about 2  3/4-inch wide in diameter. Then using the tines of a fork press down on each round in perpendicular directions to create a crisscross pattern.  Bake the cookies for 10-11 minutes or until the edges are set. Let the cookies cool on the pan for 5 minutes and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. Once the cookies are room temperature gently wrap them in plastic and place in the freezer to chill completely about 2 hours. This will make them a bit more durable since these cookies are so soft.  To prepare the sandwiches remove the pints of ice cream from the freezer and use a serrated knife to cut  3/4-1-inch thick slices by cutting through the paper container. Moving quickly use a 2 1/2-inch wide biscuit cutter to cut out uniform rounds of ice cream to sandwich between the cookies. You will end up with 7 sandwiches altogether.  To make the chocolate hard shell simply melt the chocolate chips and coconut oil together in a microwave safe bowl and whisk until smooth. Decorate the cookies as desired either by dipping in or drizzling with the chocolate hard shell then garnish with crushed peanuts if desired. Place the sandwiches back in the freezer for 10-15 minutes to firm up before enjoying.

Pork and Hominy Stew,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/soups-stews/stews/Pork and Hominy Stew,6 servings,  3 pounds boneless pork shoulder trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks Kosher salt and ground black pepper 1 tablespoon grapeseed or other neutral oil 1 large yellow onion chopped (2 cups)  3 jalape&#241;o chilies stemmed seeded and sliced into thin rings divided 8 garlic cloves minced 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 (29-ounce) can white hominy drained and rinsed 1 cup minced fresh cilantro  3/4 cup fresh lime juice plus lime wedges to serve   ,  Hominy is a type of corn kernel that has been dried and soaked in an alkali. Once rehydrated-as is the canned hominy we use in this recipe-the kernels become plump and pleasantly chewy with an earthy nutty flavor. Feel free to substitute canned pinto or pink beans if you're not a fan of hominy. Be sure to trim as much fat as possible from the pork to prevent a greasy stew. Start timing the stew once it has reached high pressure.  Don't forget to drain the hominy before using adding it to the stew.  Use paper towels to pat the pork dry then season it with salt and pepper. In a 5 1/2-liter or larger pressure cooker heat the oil over medium-high until shimmering. Add the onion and  1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook stirring occasionally until golden brown about 5 minutes. Stir half of the jalape&#241;os the garlic and cumin; cook until fragrant about 30 seconds.  Stir in the broth and hominy then stir in the pork. Lock the lid in place and bring to high pressure (second red line) over medium-high. Adjust the heat to low to stabilize pressure at the second red line. Cook for 25 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat and allow the pressure to reduce naturally for 20 minutes then quick release the remaining pressure. Carefully open the lid and tilt it away from you to release the residual steam. Check the pork; it should be fork-tender. If not lock the lid in place return to high pressure and cook for 5 more minutes. Let the stew sit for 10 minutes then stir in the cilantro and lime juice. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Spring Pea Souffle,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Spring Pea Souffle,4 servings,  2 tablespoons unsalted butter divided plus more for buttering ramekins 8 tablespoons finely grated gruyere cheese divided  1/2 cup fresh or frozen peas thawed if using frozen 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 cup whole milk 1 teaspoon chopped mint leaves 1 teaspoon lemon zest 2 large eggs separated  1/2 teaspoon sea salt Fresh ground black pepper 1 large egg white   , To make sure the souffle rises properly use an oven thermometer to check your oven's temperature. Also keep the oven door closed while the souffle is baking so it has a constant temperature in which to complete its rise. Rather than opening the door turn on the oven light to watch the magic.   Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Butter 4 (6-ounce) ramekins and dust with 2 tablespoons of the grated gruyere.   Place 1 tablespoon of butter in a small saucepan and place on the stove over medium heat. Add the peas and cook until soft about 2 minutes. Add the remaining gruyere cheese and blend using an immersion blender or transfer to a blender and puree.   Place a medium saucepan on the stove over medium heat and add the olive oil and remaining tablespoon butter. Once the butter has melted whisk in the flour to form a roux (a cooked mixture of equal parts butter and flour) stirring constantly for 1 minute. Add the milk in a steady stream whisking well to remove any lumps. Switch to a wooden spoon and stirring often cook until the mixture comes to a simmer and thickens 3 to 5 minutes.   Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the pea mixture mint and lemon zest. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and whisk in the egg yolks one at a time. Stir in salt and a few grinds of pepper.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whip attachment beat the egg whites until they just hold soft peaks. Using a silicone spatula fold one-third of the whites into the pea mixture to lighten the base. Fold in the remaining egg whites in two batches until thoroughly incorporated.   Pour the mixture into the prepared ramekins and transfer to a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the souffles are puffed and golden about 18 to 20 minutes. Serve immediately.

Pork Tenderloin with Mushrooms and Herbs Wrapped in Puff Pastry,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Pork Tenderloin with Mushrooms and Herbs Wrapped in Puff Pastry,6 servings,  1 (2-pound) pork tenderloin trimmed and silver skin removed 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 ounces unsalted butter 1 pound crimini mushrooms minced 1 large shallot minced  1/3 cup fresh bread crumbs 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1 sheet puff pastry thawed  1/2 cup heavy whipping cream 1 cup minced flat-leaf parsley 4 small cloves garlic minced 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice  1/2 cup olive oil   , This is a take on the classic dish beef wellington. Here we use pork to create a lighter dish and puff pastry instead of the traditional brioche. To balance the heavy and earthy flavors of the mushrooms the dish is finished with a simple parsley pistou.  Place the trimmed tenderloin on a cutting board. Starting about  1/3 of the way down the side slice into the tenderloin until it opens up like a book. Turn the knife around and cutting back the opposite way open up the thick half of the tenderloin. The tenderloin should know be opened like a trifold letter. Sprinkle the tenderloin with salt on both sides and let it sit until the pork has absorbed the salt about 30 minutes.  Place a large skillet on the stove over medium-high heat melt the butter then add the mushrooms. Cook the mushrooms stirring occasionally until brown about 5 minutes. Transfer the mushrooms to a medium bowl reserving the skillet.  Return the skillet to the stove add the shallots and cook until translucent about 2 minutes then add the bread crumbs. Cook briefly to toast the bread crumbs and transfer the mixture to the mushrooms. Add the sherry vinegar and season to taste with salt. Leave to cool completely.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center.  Once the mushroom mixture is cool use a silicone or offset spatula to spread the mixture over the pork in an even layer. Working from the left side roll the pork up around the mushroom filling and set aside.  Roll out the puff pastry sheet to 4 inches longer than the tenderloin. Place the tenderloin on the puff pastry and wrap the tenderloin in the pastry making sure to press the seams closed. Using a silicone pastry brush lightly coat the outside of the pastry with the cream.  Transfer the tenderloin to a parchment lined baking sheet with pastry seams down and place in the oven to bake until the pork reaches the internal temperature of 140 degrees F and the puff pastry is golden-brown about 30 minutes. When the pork is cooked allow the pork to rest 10 minutes before slicing.  While the pork is cooking place the parsley garlic lemon juice and oil in a blender and process until smooth. Set aside.  To serve: Slice into 1 1/2 inches thick transfer to warmed dinner plates and drizzle with parsley dressing. Serve immediately.

Arrabbiata Sauce,Gifts Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Diane Morgan photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Arrabbiata Sauce,6 (1-pint) jars of arrabbiata sauce,  8 pounds fresh ripe Roma plum or San Marzano tomatoes  1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 large yellow onions finely diced (about 4 cups)  1/2 cup minced serrano chiles including seeds and ribs 8 large cloves garlic minced 1 (12-ounce) can tomato paste 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons kosher or sea salt  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons citric acid such as Fruit-Fresh   , Arrabbiata means "angry" in Italian and refers to the chileinfused piquancy of this sauce. It is a dynamite way to use fresh-from-the-farmers'-market (or garden-picked) plum or Roma tomatoes. Buy yourself some disposable surgical gloves at the pharmacy and wear them when working with chiles. They will keep the caustic compound (capsaicin) that is naturally present in chiles from irritating your skin.  Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Have ready a large bowl filled with ice water. Meanwhile using a paring knife score the pointed end of each tomato with a small “x". Working in batches place the tomatoes in the boiling water for 30 seconds and then using a slotted spoon transfer them to the ice water to cool for 1 minute. Use a paring knife to peel back the skins and remove the cores. Coarsely chop the tomatoes transfer to a bowl and set aside.  In a large stockpot over medium-high heat warm the olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the onions and saute stirring frequently until soft but not brown about 5 minutes.  Add the serrano chiles and garlic and saute 1 to 2 minutes longer. Do not let the chiles or garlic brown. Add the tomato paste and stir constantly for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes sugar salt and pepper and stir to incorporate. Bring to a boil adjust the heat so the sauce just simmers cover and cook stirring occasionally until the tomatoes are no longer chunky and the sauce is thick about 30 minutes.  While the sauce is simmering prepare the preserving jars and bring water to a boil in a water bath canner.  Remove the sauce from the heat. Using a wide-mouth funnel and filling one jar at a time ladle the sauce into the hot sterilized jars leaving  1/2 inch headspace. Remove any air bubbles by running a long wooden utensil such as a chopstick or wooden skewer between the jar and the sauce. Wipe the rims clean. Seal according to the manufacturer's directions. Process the jars in a boiling water bath for 40 minutes and then turn off the heat. Wait 5 minutes and then lift the canning rack and using a canning jar lifter transfer the jars to a towel-lined sturdy rimmed baking sheet and let them rest. Check the seals wipe the jars and label.  Storing: Store the jars in a cool dark place for up to 1 year.   
Mustard Seed Crusted Prime Rib with Shallot-Cabernet Sauce,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Mustard Seed Crusted Prime Rib with Shallot-Cabernet Sauce,8 servings,  Prime Rib: Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  1/2 cup plus 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard divided 4 garlic cloves minced 9 1/2-pound bone-in standing prime rib roast trimmed (about 4 ribs)  2 tablespoons yellow mustard seeds  Shallot-Cabernet Sauce:  2 large shallots minced  3/4 cup brandy 2 cups low-sodium beef broth 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1 cup Cabernet red wine 3 sprigs fresh thyme   , For some Christmas dinner wouldn't be complete without beef. Here a decadent prime rib roast is coated in mustard seeds and served with a flavorful red wine sauce. If your roast does not weigh the same as ours use this formula to calculate the cooking time: allow 15 minutes per pound plus 15 minutes extra for medium rare. Offer the outside slices to those who prefer their meat well done. The rarest slices will be from the middle of the roast.  To prepare the beef: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Sprinkle beef lightly with coarse salt and generously with pepper. Mix  1/2 cup of the Dijon mustard and garlic in small bowl; rub all over roast.   Place roast bone side down in roasting pan. Sprinkle mustard seeds over pressing to adhere. Roast 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 120 degrees F about 2 1/2 hours for medium-rare.  Transfer roast to carving board with a well. Tent roast with foil; let rest 30 minutes.   To prepare shallot-cabernet sauce:  Drain and reserve any excess fat from pan leaving just a coating in the pan.  Place roasting pan over 2 burners on medium heat and add shallots. Cook until soft adding back any needed fat to keep shallots from sticking.     Add brandy being careful of the open flame and stir for 30 seconds. Whisk in broth and the remaining 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pan. Boil until reduced to about 1 3/4 cups jus stirring occasionally about 10 minutes.    Whisk in the balsamic vinegar and wine. Add thyme and increase heat just a bit to bring to a boil. Once boiling reduce to a simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon about 8 minutes. Remove the thyme sprigs and add any juices that have drained from the roast. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Pour into a warmed gravy boat.  To serve: Slice roast thickly. Serve with shallot-cabernet sauce.   
Pollo al Mattone - Chicken Under a Brick,Academia Barilla adapted by the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Pollo al Mattone - Chicken Under a Brick,4 servings,  1 (2- or 3-pound) chicken split down backbone or halved 2 cloves garlic chopped 2 tablespoons Sapori Italiani Academia Barilla to taste 1 lemon juiced 2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil Toscano IGP Academia Barilla  1/2 teaspoon Sicilian Sea Salt with Black Olives Academia Barilla Pepper to taste   , This traditional Tuscan cooking method results in incredibly crispy skin and intensely flavorful meat. Weighting the chicken ensures that each part of the chicken is approximately the same thickness so it cooks quickly and evenly. The weight also causes the fat under the skin to render and melt out leaving the skin deliciously crisp.  Split the chicken: with kitchen shears cut along the backbone (if you like remove the backbone completely by also cutting on the other side). Then open the chicken like a book. Turn it bone-side down and press down on the breastbone with your hands. Pull each leg hard until they are pulled out of their sockets and then continue to press down until the chicken is flat.  Press the chicken with your hands to a uniform thickness. In a bowl large enough to fit the chicken mix together the garlic Sapori seasoning lemon juice olive oil Sicilian Sea Salt and pepper to form a marinade. Place the chicken in the marinade and allow to marinate for 2 to 4 hours.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F degrees. Remove the chicken from the marinade. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the base of the mattone over medium heat. When it is hot add the chicken skin side down place the weighted lid on top of the chicken and place in the oven. Cook for approximately 45 minutes turning 3 or 4 times and basting with pan juices. Cut the cooked chicken into four pieces and serve immediately.  Garnish with lemon slices and serve.   
Classic Fried Chicken,Sur La Table,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Classic Fried Chicken,4 to 6 servings,  For the marinade: 1 (3- to 4-pound) whole chicken cut into 8 to 10 serving pieces 5 cups buttermilk divided 12 sprigs fresh thyme roughly chopped 6 sprigs fresh rosemary roughly chopped 3 bay leaves 4 tablespoons kosher salt divided plus more as needed 4 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper divided  For the seasoned flour dredge: 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 3 teaspoons paprika 2 teaspoons dried oregano 2 teaspoons rubbed sage 1 teaspoon dried marjoram  For the dip: 1 large egg 1 teaspoon baking powder  1/2 teaspoon baking soda Vegetable oil for frying   , Some contemporary cooks are wary of frying but here's a reason to make an exception. This chicken is so moist so crunchy and savory it's worth any trepidation. The key is to use a pan that doesn't crowd the chicken (use two or cook in batches if necessary) and-most importantly-to keep an eye on the heat. The chicken should sizzle merrily in the oil but it shouldn't brown too quickly or the outside will be done before the inside is fully cooked.  Arrange the chicken in a large baking dish and set aside in the refrigerator. In a large mixing bowl combine 4 cups buttermilk thyme rosemary bay leaves 2 tablespoons salt and 2 teaspoons pepper and pour over the chicken. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or up to 8 hours. Alternatively use a vacuum sealer or instant marinator to reduce the marinating time to 45 minutes.  Place rack over baking sheet. Remove chicken from marinade and set on rack and drain thoroughly.   In a large mixing bowl whisk together the flour remaining 2 tablespoons salt remaining 2 teaspoons black pepper paprika oregano sage and marjoram and set aside.   In another large mixing bowl whisk together remaining 1 cup buttermilk egg baking powder and baking soda. The mixture will bubble and foam as the baking powder reacts with the liquid creating aeration in the batter by releasing carbon dioxide.  To a deep heavy Dutch oven or cast-iron 12-inch skillet on medium-high heat add about 1 inch of oil and heat until the oil registers 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. If your pan is smaller use two pans or fry the chicken in batches.   To double dip the chicken pick up a piece of marinated chicken dredge the piece in the seasoned flour making sure all the creases and corners are well coated. Dip the chicken in the egg mixture to coat and then dredge back in the seasoned flour and shaking off any excess back into the egg mixture then flour mixture.  Add coated chicken to the hot oil carefully skin side down. Always place hot food items in a hot skillet away from your body to avoid splashes to your skin and clothes. Once all the chicken is in the pan turn the heat to medium so the sizzling is steady and cover the pan. After about 15 minutes remove the lid and check the chicken. If a rich brown crust has developed turn each piece. If the chicken still looks pale increase the heat slightly and cook for a few more minutes before turning. Continue frying the chicken until well browned on the second side and the meat is totally cooked through and registers 165 degrees F on an instant read thermometer about 30 to 40 minutes total. If cooking chicken in batches allow the oil temperature to return to 375 degrees F before starting the second batch.  Transfer the chicken to a wire cooling rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Immediately sprinkle lightly with salt and serve warm or room temperature.

Red Chili Chicken,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Red Chili Chicken,4 servings,  2 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil 2 ounces whole dried ancho chilies stemmed and seeded  2/3 cups water 1 tablespoon dried oregano Mexican if available 2 garlic cloves smashed 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 1 tablespoon cider vinegar Kosher salt and ground black pepper  1/2 teaspoon ground cumin  3/4 teaspoon cinnamon 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs trimmed of excess fat   ,  Boneless skinless chicken thighs become especially tender when simmered in this red chili adobo sauce. After a brief time on the stovetop the Durotherm's insulated base allows the chicken to finish cooking off heat. For a make-ahead option the chicken stays hot in its sauce for up to two hours. We liked this served as tacos with corn tortillas cilantro scallions and lime wedges.  Don't let the chicken and chili sauce boil while cooking on the stovetop. This will lead to scorching and tough meat.  In a Durotherm over medium-high heat the oil until shimmering (if using gas don't let the flames reach the sides of the pot). Add the chilies and toast until lightly browned about 20 seconds per side. Transfer the chilies to a food processor and the oil to a small bowl; set aside. Process the chilies until coarsely chopped about 30 seconds.  In a small saucepan bring the water to a boil. Add the chilies oregano and garlic then cover remove from heat and let sit for 15 minutes.   In the food processor add the sugar vinegar 2 1/2 teaspoons salt  3/4 teaspoon pepper the cumin cinnamon and reserved chili oil. Add the chili-water mixture and process until smooth about 1 minute scraping the bowl as needed.  Pour the mixture into the Durotherm add the chicken and stir to coat with the sauce. Cover and bring to a simmer over medium. Reduce to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes adjusting the temperature as needed to maintain a simmer. Leave the lid slightly ajar at first to ensure you see that a proper simmer is reached then cover the pot and don't open again.  Remove the pot from the heat and place on the heat-retaining base; do not remove the lid. Let sit covered at least 20 minutes and up to 2 hours.  When ready to serve use 2 forks to shred the chicken in the pot tossing to combine with the sauce. Return the Durotherm to the stove and cook uncovered over medium until the meat is coated in the chili mixture and a spoon dragged through the sauce leaves a trail about 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Chocolate Chip Chickpea Blondies,Samah Dada,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Chocolate Chip Chickpea Blondies, 12,  Coconut oil for the cake pan (optional)  1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas  1/3 cup creamy almond butter (best at room temperature)   3/4 cup maple syrup  1/2 cup coconut sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 5 tablespoons almond flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  3/4 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 cup chocolate chips plus more for pressing on top    , I know what you're thinking. How could you what would possess you to put chickpeas in a dessert?  Isn't that a little sacrilegious?  While I'm sure some would say that yes don't you dare please confine chickpeas to hummus the problem is that I can't unmake these chickpea blondies and therefore unlearn how good they are. I know too much now.   The sketchy but mostly great thing about this recipe is that you would have no idea that there were chickpeas in it. I've accidentally tricked many people in my day because the truth is the chickpeas just end up adding to the texture making it seem like you're biting into soft chewy cookie dough. The only trouble I think you might run into is getting all of the batter from the processor to your pan without tasting it. I have failed pretty much every time.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease an 8-inch square cake pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper.   Drain the can of chickpeas and rinse them well under cold water for 1 minute. Make sure they are thoroughly rinsed!    Place the rinsed chickpeas almond butter maple syrup coconut sugar vanilla almond flour salt baking powder and baking soda in a food processor or high-speed blender. Process or blend on high speed until the batter is completely smooth. Scrape down the sides of the blender or processor to get it fully incorporated if needed.   Turn off your processor or blender and pour in the chocolate chips gently folding them into the batter. I always recommend using your soul rather than a measuring cup to determine how many to use.  Transfer the batter to the prepared cake pan spreading it out evenly. Press additional chocolate chips on top of the batter—because obviously.   Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until the edges are golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake as this will dry the blondies out. It should have a slightly underbaked texture—that's how they are supposed to be!   Let cool in the pan for at least 25 minutes before slicing and serving as they will firm up after they've cooled down.   Recipe from DADA EATS LOVE TO COOK IT. Copyright &#169; 2021 by Samah Dada.

Drying the beans thoroughly minimized splatter and halving them on a steep bias allowed them to absorb more flavor. A final dose of vinegar added off heat prevented the beans from losing their bright green color.  Don't use an ill-fitting lid. A proper seal is key to this recipe. Have the lid ready as soon as you add water to the wok.  In a small bowl stir together the sugar fish sauce and soy sauce. Set aside.   Heat a wok over medium-high until a drop of water evaporates within 1 to 2 seconds of contact about 3 minutes. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the beans in an even layer over the bottom and up the sides of the wok. Cook without stirring until beginning to color about 3 minutes. Add the water and immediately cover the wok. Cook until the beans are bright green and barely tender about 1 minute.  Clear a space in the center of the wok then add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the clearing. Add the ginger and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Stir the sugar-fish sauce mixture to recombine then pour in a thin stream along the sides of the wok. Stir-fry until the liquid has thickened and coats the beans about 1 minute. Off  heat stir in the vinegar. Taste and season with pepper.

Apple Cranberry Crumble Pie,Shoofly Pie Co. in Seattle Washington,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Apple Cranberry Crumble Pie,1 (10-inch) pie, Flaky Pie Dough  2 1/2 level cups all-purpose unbleached flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 8 ounces (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter cut into tablespoon-sized cubes 4-8 tablespoons cold water  Filling   2 1/2-3 pounds (5-7 medium) firm tart apples 2/3 cup sugar 2 tablespoons all-purpose unbleached flour 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 1/2 cups cranberries (fresh or frozen)  Oat Crumble Topping    3/4 cup all-purpose unbleached flour  3/4 cup light brown sugar  3/4 cup oats 1 pinch of salt 4 ounces (1 stick) cold unsalted butter cut into half-inch cubes   , This recipe was custom made for the Sur La Table Stoneware Pie Dish and contains 25% more crust and filling than standard pie dishes. The directions utilize a food processor but the dough can also be formed in a stand mixer or by hand.  Flaky Pie Dough  Use metal blade of food processor. Put all dry ingredients in and pulse to mix. Scatter butter cubes over flour mixture. Pulse a few times until the butter is cut in and pea-sized.  Add 4 tablespoons of cold water (drizzle evenly over the top) and pulse a few times until the dough begins to clump into small balls. Open lid and try to press the dough together. If it doesn’t hold together when pressed begin adding more water 1 tbsp. at a time pulsing in between until it holds together.  Divide the dough roughly into two balls one slightly larger than the other. (The larger round will be used for your bottom crust and the smaller round can be used for decorative cutouts or a top crust.) Flatten into discs about  3/4" thick and 4-5" in diameter. Wrap with plastic and put in refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes. (If not using within 24-48 hours double wrap with plastic and put in freezer for up to one month. Defrost by thawing in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours.)  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Put a sheet pan on lowest rack. Make Flaky Pie Dough x 1 (above). Roll out the larger disc of pie dough into a circle of approximately 14 " diameter; center in pie dish and gently but firmly press into corners. Trim edges if needed. Fold overhang of dough under itself and crimp around the edge of the pie dish. If desired roll out smaller disc of dough to use for decorative cutouts. Chill both in refrigerator.  Prepare Filling  Peel and core apples. Slice into  3/4" wedges then slice in half. Measure out 6 cups of apple slices into a bowl. Add sugar flour lemon juice and cinnamon. Gently toss to mix well. Let sit for 10-15 minutes.  Prepare Oat Crumble  Combine flour sugar salt and mix evenly. Add oats and mix to combine. Scatter cubes of butter into dry mixture to coat and work with fingers until mixture resembles sandy coarse crumbs.  Form Pie  Roughly divide cranberries into thirds and apples in half. Fill pie shell by placing a layer of cranberries on bottom then a layer of apples. Repeat and finish with remaining cranberries.   Press down on the fruit gently to minimize apple gaps. Top with oat crumble mixture: gently press onto the top of the fruit evenly covering the entire top and particularly near the rim of the pie dish. If desired cut decorative shapes out of smaller round of dough place on top of pie and sprinkle lightly with sugar. Chill pie for 15-20 minutes until dough is firm to the touch.  Bake  Place chilled pie on preheated pan in oven and bake for 30 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees F and bake for 30-50 minutes more or until thick juices bubble up and oat crumble is golden brown. If the top is browning too quickly after the first 20 minutes cover pie with parchment paper or foil until done (or nearly done).

Once the bristly beard is ripped off the mussel begins to die. You always want to cook fresh live mussels because they'll have the best flavor. If you aren't going to use the mussels right away ask your fishmonger for ones with the beard on. Cleaning is easy you just tear off the fuzzy part and rinse under water.

Asparagus with Egg and Crispy Pancetta,Sansaire,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Asparagus with Egg and Crispy Pancetta,1 serving,  1 bunch asparagus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter cubed  1/2 cup pancetta cubed 2 sous-vide eggs (make ahead)  3/4 cup hollandaise sauce (made ahead or store bought) 1 teaspoon lemon zest  3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Flaky sea salt to taste   , Choose a container large enough to hold your food with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the container using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator turning the silver temperature ring above the display to 185 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.   Using a vegetable peeler peel the asparagus from the tip towards the base.   Line up the asparagus on a cutting board with the bottom of the Ziploc bag as your guide to how long your asparagus should be cut. Using a sharp knife carefully cut the asparagus so that the lengths are about the same size as the bag to enable the asparagus to snuggly fit into the bag.  Place the asparagus and butter into the Ziploc bag so that the bottom of the asparagus is flat within the bag. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the asparagus. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag and leave the asparagus to cook in the water until tender 15 minutes.  Meanwhile pan-fry the pancetta until crispy. Reserve.  To Serve: Using tongs carefully remove the asparagus from the Ziploc bag into a warmed platter. Working one at a time crack and open the sous vide eggs into a small bowl. Use a slotted spoon to place the egg on top of the asparagus discarding any unset egg white that remains in the bowl. Top with hollandaise sauce lemon zest cayenne pepper and salt to taste.

Always preheat your oven and stone before baking pizza. Roll dough from the center outwards so the dough spreads evenly. Season your pizza stone by rubbing a light layer of olive oil over it with a paper towel and letting it sit for about an hour. Once the porous stone absorbs the oil you can use the stone as usual. The porous nature of your stone means that it will absorb everything that touches it including soaps and detergents. It is very important not to use soap when cleaning your stone. Clean with a stiff brush and some water to brush away any particles.  Dough: In a measuring cup stir together water and yeast until yeast is dissolved. In a large bowl whisk together flour and salt olive oil and add yeast mixture stirring until a soft dough forms. On a lightly floured surface knead dough until smooth and elastic about 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 1 hour.  Topping: Place pizza stone the oven and preheat oven to 475 degrees F. The stone needs to heat in the oven for 30 minutes to 1 hour before baking pizza.  While dough is resting in a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium high heat and saute onions for about 8-10 minutes until onions are soft. Add garlic and tomatoes to the onions and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook mixture for 15 to 20 minutes until tomatoes breakdown and sauce is aromatic.

This is a good dish for late summer when these vegetables are at their prime. You can cook the vegetables a day ahead and then layer and bake them just before serving. The topping of Manchego cheese makes this dish hearty enough to be enjoyed as a main course. You can bake it in 1 large or 6 or more small cazuelas (gratins).  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Arrange the tomato halves and bell pepper halves cut side down on a on a large nonreactive rimmed sheet pan. Drizzle evenly with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 25 minutes.  Meanwhile arrange the eggplant slices on a second rimmed sheet pan. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in the oven with the tomatoes and peppers and roast for about 10 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottoms. Remove the eggplant from the oven and use a wide spatula to turn the slices over. Roast for about 10 minutes more or until the eggplant is golden brown. Remove from then oven.  At this point 25 minutes will have elapsed and the peppers will be ready to turn. Remove the sheet pan from the oven and use tongs to turn with them over. Return the pan to the oven and roast for 20 minutes more or until the peppers are blistered and blackened and the tomatoes have collapsed. Remove the pan from the oven cover with a sheet of aluminum foil and let stand for about 20 minutes or until slightly cooled. Turn the oven off.  While the peppers tomatoes and eggplant are roasting place the potatoes in a medium saucepan and add water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes or until tender. Drain let cool and cut the potatoes into  1/2-inch-thick rounds.  Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil to the cazuela or a 10- to 12-inch skillet and heat over low heat. When the oil is hot increase the heat to medium and add the zucchini in batches. Saute for about 5 minutes per side or until browned. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to transfer the zucchini to a colander to drain off the excess juices.  Add the onion slices to the cazuela or skillet and saute stirring over medium heat for 15 minutes or until golden. Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add the paprika and parsley and remove from the heat. Season with  1/2 teaspoon of salt and a generous grinding of pepper. Transfer the onion mixture to a side dish.  Lift the foil from the rimmed sheet pan with the tomatoes and peppers. If the skins have loosened peel them back with your fingertips and discard. If the skins are not loose leave them on.  In the cazuela or 2-quart shallow baking dish make single layers of the vegetables in the following order: the eggplant onion slices peppers potatoes zucchini and tomatoes. Top evenly with the cheese.  Place the cazuela or baking dish (gratin)  in the hot oven (it's fine to put the cazuela (gratin) in a hot oven because it has been preheated on the stove top) and bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the cheese has melted.  Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve directly from the cazuela.

Lattice-Topped Peach Pie,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Lattice-Topped Peach Pie,1 9" pie serving 8 to 10,  2 recipes Flaky Pie Dough 1 egg beaten 1 tablespoon sparkling sugar demerara sugar or granulated sugar    Filling:  3  1/2 pounds (6 to 7) fresh peaches  1/2 cup to  3/4 cup granulated sugar depending on sweetness of fruit 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  1/8 teaspoon kosher salt  3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon cornstarch   , The pie will keep at room temperature under a cake dome for up to 2 days. For longer storage cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Reheat at 375 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes to warm the filling and re-crisp the crust.  To shape bottom crust: Roll out 1 disc of pie dough on a floured surface to a 13" round that is  1/8" thick. Starting at edge furthest from you roll edge of dough over and around rolling pin. Lift rolling pin and center in middle of pie plate. Slowly unroll dough into your plate. Use kitchen scissors to trim dough so it overhangs edge of pan by 1"; chill until ready to use.   To prepare the lattice crust strips:  With second disc firmly shape dough into a small rectangle and then roll it into a large  1/8" thick rectangle. Trim to a 14" x 12" rectangle. Use a pastry wheel pizza cutter or kitchen knife to cut dough into fourteen 1" wide strips. If strips of dough are warm and difficult to move chill them on a baking sheet for 10 minutes.   To blanch peaches:  Bring a large pot of water to boil. While it heats score an x in the bottom of each peach. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Blanch peaches in boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes until skins begin to peel back. Using a slotted spoon or spider plunge peaches into ice water. Once they are cool enough to handle remove peach skins pits and cut into 1" slices.  To prepare filling:  To a large mixing bowl add peach slices and remaining filling ingredients; stir thoroughly. Transfer filling into chilled pie shell.   To assemble pie:  Lay 7 chilled lattice strips evenly spaced horizontally across pie filling. Working from right side fold back every other strip (4 strips in total) so that they are doubled back on themselves. Lay a vertical strip of dough next to this new fold. The new strip should be perpendicular to and a half an inch away from first vertical strip. Repeat twice more until half of pie has been latticed. Turn pie so un-latticed side faces you and continue weaving in same manner until all strips have been used.   With a pair of kitchen scissors trim lattice ends even with overhanging bottom crust. Fold any lattice overhang under bottom crust and crimp or form a decorative border.   Freeze pie for at least 10 minutes before baking.   Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and position an oven rack in bottom third of oven.   To bake pie: Using a pastry brush lightly brush lattice with a thin layer of beaten egg. Sprinkle crust with 1 tablespoon of sugar. Using a pie crust shield or aluminum foil cover outside edge of crust to prevent it from burning. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove pie crust shield and continue to bake until golden brown and fruit is bubbling and tender 50 to 60 minutes total. Transfer pie to a cooling rack and allow the pie to cool for at least 20 minutes.   Serve warm or at room temperature with a scoop of ice cream.

Bittersweet Chocolate Bread Pudding,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Bittersweet Chocolate Bread Pudding,8 to 10 servings,  1 loaf (1 to 1 1/2 pounds) challah brioche or other rich dense bread 1  3/4 cups (14 ounces) whole milk 1  3/4 cups (14 ounces) heavy whipping cream 8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate (up to 70 percent cacao) finely chopped 2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks 1 3/4 cups (8  3/4 ounces) sugar Pinch of salt Caramel Sauce and Softly Whipped Cream or vanilla ice cream for serving   , Perhaps the darkest most intense chocolate bread pudding you've ever experienced this recipe depends on  1/2 pound of top-quality chocolate and a long leisurely soak of custard and bread before baking. For best results start the day before you want to serve the pudding-the next day simply slip it into the oven.  To add even more chocolate flavor stir a cup of milk chocolate or white chocolate chips or chopped bar chocolate into the custard and bread mixture before baking.  Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly butter the cake pan.  Toast the bread: use the serrated knife to cut away the crust from all sides of the bread. If you are using challah which is braided just do the best you can and don't worry about the bits of crust in the crevices of the braid. Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes. Spread the cubes on the baking sheet and toast in the oven for 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. Measure out 4 cups of bread cubes and place them in the prepared cake pan. Transfer the remaining bread cubes to a resealable plastic bag and set aside (or freeze) for another use.  Make the custard: heat the milk and cream in the medium saucepan over medium heat just until the mixture simmers. Remove the pan from the heat and add the chopped chocolate. Let it sit for 1 minute then whisk vigorously to blend the chocolate into the mixture.  Temper the eggs: whisk the eggs yolks sugar and salt in the medium bowl to blend thoroughly. Twist a damp kitchen towel into a rope and wrap it around the bottom of the bowl to secure it while you temper the eggs. Pour about  1/2 cup of the chocolate mixture into the eggs whisking constantly. Once blended whisk in another  1/2 cup. Then slowly pour the rest of the chocolate mixture into the eggs whisking constantly.  Soak the bread cubes: pour the custard through the strainer over the bread in the baking dish. Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and press down gently so that all the bread cubes are soaked with the custard. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours preferably overnight. This gives the bread cubes plenty of time to soak up the chocolate custard turning them from white to a deep chocolate brown color throughout. Every once in a while remove the plastic and gently stir the mixture then return it to the refrigerator.  Bake and serve the bread pudding: preheat the oven to 325&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Remove the plastic wrap from the pan and bake the pudding for 60 to 75 minutes until the center is set. To check use a spoon to press down firmly in the center of the pan. The pudding is done when the center feels firm and no loose custard bubbles up around the spoon. Transfer to a rack to cool for 15 to 20 minutes then cut the warm pudding into wedges and serve. Top with a spoonful of whipped cream or ice cream and pour caramel sauce over the top.  Storing: bread pudding is at its best the first day or two but it can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 4 days. Reheat in a 325&deg;F oven for 20 to 25 minutes until heated through.

To prepare hollandaise sauce: In a medium saute pan cook white wine vinegar shallots and peppercorns until nearly dry. Cool the reduction to room temperature then strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium stainless steel bowl-you should have about a tablespoon of liquid.    In a medium saucepan simmer two inches of water. Once the reduction has cooled whisk in the egg yolks and place bowl over the simmering water whisking constantly until thickened and warm. To avoid overcooking the mixture be sure that the water is just barely simmering with no visible signs of surface action just steam rising.  As the egg yolks warm they increase in volume.  If they become too warm and begin to coagulate around the sides and bottom remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.  When the yolks have tripled in volume and the mixture thickly coats the back of a spoon remove the bowl from the simmering water.  Stabilize the bowl by setting on a towel or on a towel inside of another bowl.  Add the butter in a slow thin stream whisking constantly as it is incorporated. The sauce will begin to thicken as more butter is added.  If too thick add a little water or lemon juice.  If the sauce does start to break try adding a small amount of water and whisking until the sauce is smooth before adding more butter.  If that doesn't work try cooking another egg yolk over simmering water until thickened then adding the broken hollandaise gradually into the new egg yolk.  Serve sauce immediately or hold sauce at a temperature of 145 degrees for up to two hours.  To prepare bacon: Place a medium nonstick skillet on the stove over a moderate heat. Add the oil and lightly cook the Canadian bacon until warm and slightly colored about 2 minutes per side. Using tongs transfer to a plate cover with foil and keep warm.   To prepare apsaragus: Using a deep saucepan with steamer steam asparagus spears until bright green and crisp tender about 2 minutes. Set asparagus aside and use the same pan to make the poached eggs.  To poach eggs: Fill a deep medium saucepan until  2/3 full of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to gently simmer and add vinegar. Place a Tovolo Perfect Poach bag into a short glass crack one egg into the pouch then immediately transfer the upright bag to the simmering water.

Classic Brioche,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Classic Brioche,ividual 6 mini loaves or 1 large loaf,  2- 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour divided 1- 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast  3/4 cup cool water 4 large eggs 2 tablespoons granulated sugar  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter softened  1/3 cup poppy seeds divided  Egg wash: 1 large egg 1 tablespoon water   , Place 1- 1/2 cups of the flour the yeast water and eggs into the bowl of a mixer or the bucket of your bread machine. Beat at medium speed (or knead in the bread machine) until smooth. Cover the mixture and let it sit for 45 minutes.   After 45 minutes the sponge will have developed some bubbles but will not have risen much because the mixture is thin. The yeast is getting a jump start.  Add the remaining 1- 3/4 cups flour the sugar and salt.   Beat for 8 to 10 minutes (switch to a dough hook if you're using a mixer) or knead in the bread machine until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and becomes shiny and elastic.   With the mixer or bread machine running add  3/4 cups poppy seeds and the soft butter 2 tablespoons at a time letting the butter become absorbed before adding the next chunk. Repeat until all of the butter is added. Cover the dough and let it rise for 1 hour. It'll be very soft at this point and should have grown by about a third. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently fold it over several times (use a bench knife to scrape up any bits that stick to the table). Place the dough into a greased bowl cover the bowl and refrigerate it for a minimum of 4 hours and up to about 16 hours. The dough will firm up considerably.  To make large brioche remove the dough from the refrigerator take a piece of the dough the size of a golf ball and set it aside. Form the rest into a round loaf. Grease a brioche pan and place the loaf into it. Take a small bowl and grease the inside and the outside of it; place this little bowl on the top of the dough and shape the reserved small piece of dough into a ball. Put this ball inside the bowl and allow the dough to rise for 1 to 1- 1/2 hours until it's an inch above the edge of the pan and looks puffy.   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and position an oven rack in the center.   Once the dough has risen remove the small bowl and gently replace the topknot. Whisk together the egg and water and brush the bread with the egg glaze and sprinkle remaining poppyseeds over top. Bake for 40 minutes until the center of the bread test 190 degrees when measured with an instant-read thermometer. Check the bread after 20 minutes: if it's browning too quickly tent the top with aluminum foil. Traditional brioche is very deep golden brown as the photo illustrates but if you want a lighter crust the foil tent will do the trick. Remove the bread from the oven and cool on a rack for 10 minutes before loosening the edge of the bread from the pan and tipping it out. Place the bread on a rack to finish cooling completely before slicing.  To make individual brioche: Divide the dough into 12 pieces. Take a marble sized piece of dough from each of the 12 pieces and set it aside. Roll each larger bit of dough into a ball; place them in greased brioche tins muffin tins or paper pans. Roll the small pieces into balls. Set them aside and let them rise with the small brioche for 45 minutes to 1 hour.    To make mini loaves (2- 1/2 x 4 inches): Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces.  Roll each piece of dough into a log shape; place them into a greased mini loaf pan and let rise for 45 minutes to an hour.  To bake individual and mini loaves:  When the dough has risen and is puffy-looking preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease your finger and poke a "belly button" into the center of each individual brioche. Gently place the small marble of dough's into these dents then brush the tops with egg wash. Bake the brioche for 25 to 30 minutes until the centers test 190 degrees when measured with an instant-read thermometer. Remove the brioche from the oven and cool on a rack before serving.  
Sous Vide Slow-Braised Bourbon Pork Belly with Wilted Mustard Greens,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Sous Vide Slow-Braised Bourbon Pork Belly with Wilted Mustard Greens,4 servings, Pork Belly   1- 1/2 pounds pork belly cut into 4 equal pieces 1 teaspoon chile powder 1 teaspoon dried oregano 8 thyme sprigs 8 bay leaves 1 cup chicken or beef stock divided and frozen into cubes 4 tablespoons butter divided Salt and pepper to taste   Glaze   3/4 cup bourbon or whiskey  1/2 cup honey  1/2 cup cider vinegar  3/4 cup Dijon mustard  3/4 cup ketchup   Mustard Greens  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium shallot minced 1 bunch mustard greens stems removed and sliced into  3/4" ribbons  1/2 cup water or chicken stock   , Celebrated by chefs from Heston Blumenthal to Thomas Keller cooking sous vide calls for slowly heating vacuum-sealed food in water at low temperatures locking in natural juices and flavors lost with other methods. Fish meat poultry and vegetables cook for hours even days with stunning results every time. The object is to cook the items evenly and not to overcook the outside while keeping the inside at the same "doneness" keeping the food succulent.   This recipe was tested with the Sansaire immersion water circulator. Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device's owner's manual for proper cooking times food handling and safety procedures.   Discover more about sous vide cooking with the Sansaire:  Click here »  To cook mustard greens heat a large pot over medium heat. Add olive oil and shallots; saute until tender 3-4 minutes. Add mustard greens and stir to combine. Add chicken stock bring to a boil and cover pot. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender 15-20 minutes. Keep warm.  Choose a pot large enough to hold the pork with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the pot using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator turning the silver temperature ring above the display to 149 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.  Season the pork belly portions generously with salt pepper chile powder and oregano.   Place each portion in separate zip lock bags with two thyme sprigs two bay leaves  3/4 cup frozen stock and 1 tablespoon butter. The bottom of the pork should lie flat along the bottom of the bag. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the pot without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the meat. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag.   Slow cook for 36 hours. When done remove bags with tongs and place in an ice bath to cool. Refrigerate until chilled about 30 minutes.   While cooling the meat make the glaze. Combine bourbon honey vinegar mustard and ketchup in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil reduce heat to medium-low and reduce until thickened 20-30 minutes. Cool completely until ready to use.  To finish pork belly remove portions from bags and trim excess fat. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and coat bottom with a thin layer of canola oil. Add pork belly portions and sear until browned on all sides. Towards the end of cooking brush bourbon glaze on all sides to coat.  To serve place each pork belly portion on a separate serving plate with mustard greens. Serve with remaining glaze on the side.

Spicy Stir-Fried Cumin Beef,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Spicy Stir-Fried Cumin Beef,4 servings,  1 pound sirloin tips trimmed  3 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce divided   1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper  4 teaspoons unseasoned rice vinegar  1 teaspoon white sugar  12 dried red chilies (such as arbol or japones) stemmed  1 1/2 tablespoons cumin seeds toasted  5 large garlic cloves minced 6 teaspoons grapeseed or other neutral oil divided  1 large yellow onion thinly sliced lengthwise  2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil  1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems   ,  Once cooking begins things move along quickly so have all ingredients prepared and a serving platter nearby. Toasted cumin seeds added both earthy flavor and crunchy texture. Breaking some of the chilies in half released the seeds giving the dish assertive spice; leave the chilies whole for a milder version. We also loved this dish made with 1 1/2 pounds of lamb leg or shoulder trimmed and thinly sliced (freeze the lamb for about 30 minutes before slicing). The chili pods are edible but we ate around them. Serve with steamed white rice.  Don't make this dish in a tight space. Toasting the chilies and searing the meat produced a fair amount of smoke and fumes. Turn your hood vent to high before beginning or open a window or two.  Cut the meat into 2-inch pieces then thinly slice each piece against the grain. In a medium bowl combine the beef 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce and the black pepper. Stir to evenly coat. Set aside at room temperature. In a small bowl combine the remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce the vinegar and sugar  Meanwhile break open about half of the chilies then transfer all of them to a wok. Toast over medium pressing the pods against the wok until fragrant and darkened in spots 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and add the cumin. In a small bowl stir together the garlic and 2 teaspoons of the oil to form a paste.  Heat a wok over medium-high until a drop of water evaporates within 1 to 2 seconds of contact about 3 minutes. Swirl 2 teaspoons of the remaining oil in the wok add the onion then stir-fry using a metal spatula until charred in spots and partially softened 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the cumin seeds and chilies.  Return the wok to high add 1 teaspoon of grapeseed oil then arrange half of the beef in a single layer on the bottom and up the sides of the wok. Cook undisturbed until deeply browned on the bottom 1 to 2 minutes. Stir scraping the bottom and sides and cook until no pink remains 60 to 90 seconds. Transfer to the bowl with the onion. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef.  In the wok over medium-high cook the garlic paste mashing the mixture until fragrant about 30 seconds. Add the beef onion chilies and cumin. Stir the soy sauce-vinegar mixture and pour in a thin stream along the sides of the wok. Stir-fry scraping up any browned bits until the liquid is thickened about 1 minute. Off heat stir in the sesame oil and cilantro.

Chile-Glazed Baby Back Ribs,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Chile-Glazed Baby Back Ribs,about 6 servings,  For the ribs: 1 tablespoon sea salt 3 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 tablespoon dry mustard 1 tablespoon paprika 1 tablespoon chile powder 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 racks baby back pork ribs (about 4 pounds)   For the glaze:  1 large shallot roughly chopped  2 large garlic cloves roughly chopped  3/4 cup apple cider vinegar 3 chipotle chiles in adobo plus 1 tablespoon sauce or more based on spice preference (use caution as the chiles are very spicy)  1 cup honey  2 teaspoons sea salt  1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   , Pork ribs are often slow-cooked on a grill or in a smoker but knowing how impractical that can be for a home cook this recipe offers a simpler approach that delivers tender flavor-packed ribs that don’t require constant tending. First the ribs are fully cooked in the oven until tender and then the ribs are brushed with a spicy honey glaze and finished quickly on the grill.   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.   For the ribs: Combine the spices together in a small bowl. Remove the silver skin from the underside of the ribs by sliding your fingers under the thin membrane and pulling it off. Repeat with the second rack. Rub the ribs with the seasoning on both sides. Place in a single layer in a large roasting pan and cover tightly with foil. Place the roasting pan into the oven and bake until the ribs are tender about 1 1/2 hours.  For the sauce: In the bowl of a food processor add all the glaze ingredients and puree. Transfer mixture to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook glaze uncovered stirring occasionally until sauce is thickened and reduced to a syrupy consistency about 10 minutes.   For grilling: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium heat. Grill the ribs on each side for 5 minutes. Using a silicone brush baste ribs generously with glaze and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes. (The sauce goes on at the end because it contains sugar and you don't want to burn your ribs.)  To serve: Let ribs rest 5 minutes before slicing into individual ribs. Serve ribs with extra glaze on the side.

Brined Double Cut Pork Chops with Barbecue Sauce,Charlie Palmer Remington Camp Cooking,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Brined Double Cut Pork Chops with Barbecue Sauce,4 servings,  4 bone-in double-cut pork chops about 14 to 16 ounces each   1/2 Basic Brine recipe (recipe to follow)  Olive oil for brushing Remington Bourbon Barbecue Sauce   Basic Brine (makes 4 cups)   4 cups water  3/4  cup kosher salt (never iodized)  2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon black peppercorns 1 tablespoon dried thyme 1 tablespoon dried rosemary 1 tablespoon crushed dried bay leaves 5 cloves garlic smashed (optional)    , A flavorful brine soak combined with Charlie Palmer's Bourbon Barbecue Sauce produces this exceptionally fragrant tender and delicious pork dish.  Making the brine: In a saucepan combine all of the ingredients and place over moderate heat. Two things happen here: the liquid is heated to the point where the salt and sugar dissolve into the brine and the brine becomes infused with the flavor of the spice components.  When the brine comes to a gentle boil remove the pan from the heat.  Avoid reducing the liquid and upsetting the ratio.  Set it aside to steep and extract as much flavor as possible as it cools.  Marinating and cooking the meat: In a large nonreactive container combine the meat and the brine and let sit overnight in the refrigerator. Remove the chops from the brine and pat dry on both sides.   Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush the chops with olive oil and sear 1 to 2 minutes or until grill marks form rotating the chops 90 degrees afterwards to create a cross-hatch pattern.

Chicken Pot Pies,GreenPan,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Chicken Pot Pies,6 servings,  1 tablespoon peanut oil 3 cups sliced mushrooms 1 onion (finely chopped)  5 carrots (sliced)  4 cups chicken stock (choose low-sodium for a healthy alternative)  4 tablespoons butter  1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 pounds chicken breasts (cut into 1-inch cubes)   3/4 cup frozen peas 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 1 egg (lightly beaten)  Salt and pepper Pie crust (recipe to follow)   The Perfect Pie Crust Makes 1 (9-or 10-inch) pie shell.   1 3/4 cups (6 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes  3/4 to  1/3 cup ice water   , The Perfect Crust: Recipe by Cindy Mushet and Sur La Table The Art & Soul of Baking (Andrews McMeel)  This recipe can be used to make both sweet and savory pies and tarts. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month. You can also save more time by making the dough in the food processor. Place the flour and cold butter in the processor bowl and pulse to cut the butter into the flour then transfer to a large mixing bowl and proceed with the recipe. Make sure to weigh your ingredients for best results.   To make the dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring with the fork.   Gather the clumps of dough together on the work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.   Chicken Pot Pies:  Cooking and preparation time: About 40 to 50 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.   Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the mushrooms and onion and cook over medium heat stirring frequently for 7 minutes. Add the chicken cubes carrots celery and half the stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 12 minutes until the vegetables are almost tender.  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook stirring continuously for 4 minutes. Gradually beat in the remaining stock. Simmer stirring until thick. Stir in the vegetable mixture chicken peas and thyme. Simmer for another 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture among six ramekins.   Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut out 6 circles (1 inch larger than the ramekins). Place the dough circles on top of the filling and crimp the edges. Cut a small cross in the centers. Bake the ramekins in the oven for 15 minutes at 400 degrees F until golden brown.

Lattice-Top Nectarine-Blackberry Pie,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Lattice-Top Nectarine-Blackberry Pie,1 (9-inch) pie,  2 recipes Flaky Pie and Tart Dough:  Click here for recipe » 6 medium (2 3/4 pounds) nectarines 1 half-pint basket (6 ounces) blackberries  1/3 cup (2 1/2 ounces) sugar plus 1 to 2 teaspoons for sprinkling 3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon ( 1/2 ounce) freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 large egg yolk 2 tablespoons milk or cream Vanilla cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che almond cream or vanilla ice cream for serving  , A carefully woven lattice is the crowning glory of a summer pie providing a tempting glimpse of the sweet fruit within through the slatted golden brown crust.  Roll out the pie/tart dough:  Click here for recipe »  Transfer to a 9-inch pie pan and chill until ready to use. Firmly shape the other recipe of dough into a small rectangle then roll it into a 14 by 12-inch rectangle that is about  1/8 inch thick trimming if necessary to reach the right dimensions. Carefully fold the dough rectangle into quarters transfer it to a baking sheet unfold and chill until ready to use.  Make the filling: Rinse the nectarines and pat dry. Use a paring knife to cut each in half remove the pit and cut each half into 4 or 5 slices. Transfer to the large bowl. Pour the blackberries out onto a baking sheet. Pick through them and discard any debris or molded berries. (Do not wash or they will absorb the water and turn to mush.) Add the berries to the nectarine slices. Add the sugar flour and lemon juice and gently toss with a spatula until the fruit is evenly coated.  Scrape the filling into the chilled pie shell. From the chilled rectangle of dough create a lattice. Refrigerate the pie for 30 minutes but no longer than 1 hour.  Make a lattice top: For a lattice-top pie use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough so it overhangs the edge of the pan by 1 inch. Chill while you cut the lattice strips. Firmly shape the dough into a small rectangle then roll it into a large 1⁄8-inch-wide rectangle. Trim to a 14 by 12-inch rectangle. Use a pastry wheel pizza cutter or kitchen knife to cut the dough into fourteen 1-inch wide strips. If the strips of dough are warm and difficult to move chill them on a baking sheet for 10 minutes. Spoon the filling into thepie shell.  Lay 7 of the lattice strips evenly spaced horizontally across the filling. Working from the right side fold back every other strip (4 strips total) so that they are doubled back on themselves. Lay a vertical strip of dough down the center next to the folds in the strips. Unfold the horizontal folded strips back over this strip. Again working from the right side fold the other 3 horizontal strips back on themselves. Lay a second vertical strip of dough next to this new fold. The new strip should be parallel to and  1/2" inch from the first vertical strip.   Repeat twice more until half of the pie has been latticed. Turn the pie so the unlatticed side faces you and continue weaving in the same manner until all the strips have been used. With a pair of kitchen scissors trim any lattice ends even with the overhanging bottom crust. Fold the overhang under and crimp or form a decorative border.  Bake and serve the pie: Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F and position a rack in the bottom third of the oven. In a small bowl beat the egg yolk with the milk or cream to create an egg wash then use the pastry brush to lightly glaze the lattice and outside edge of the pie crust. Sprinkle the top with the 1 to 2 teaspoons sugar. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling and tender (test with the tip of a paring knife). Transfer to a cooling rack and allow the pie to cool for 40 to 60 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature with cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che almond cream or vanilla ice cream.  Storing: The pie will keep at room temperature under a cake dome for up to 2 days. For longer storage cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Reheat in a 375&deg;F oven for 15 to 20 minutes to warm the filling and re-crisp the crust.   
Bruised Stone Fruit Galette,Recipe courtesy of Scraps,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Bruised Stone Fruit Galette,8 slices  Learn more about Scraps ,  Crust: 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour plus more for board 1 tablespoon turbinado (raw) sugar plus more for sprinkling on crust  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter cut into pieces 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or vodka About  3/4 cup ice water  Filling and Assembly: 1 pound stone fruit pitted and sliced (such as peaches nectarines plums apricots and/or cherries)  1 lemon zested and juiced  1/3 cup turbinado (raw) sugar 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour   3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 egg beaten  Yogurt whipped cream: 1 cup heavy cream  1/2 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt  2 tablespoons powdered sugar plus more for garnish  3/4 teaspoon rosewater (optional)   , Make the crust: In a large bowl combine flour sugar and salt. Use your fingers or a fork to work butter into flour until you have pea-size pieces of butter. Stir in vinegar (or vodka) and add ice water a few splashes at a time to create a shaggy dough. Avoid adding too much water.   Working quickly use your hands to knead the dough into a rough rectangle and fold once. Shape into a round disk and wrap tightly in parchment paper or plastic wrap and freeze for 30 minutes or refrigerate for a few hours until firm.  Make the filling: When you're ready to bake heat oven to 400 degrees F. Stir together stone fruit lemon zest juice sugar flour and salt.  Roll out the dough: Lightly sprinkle work surface with flour. Unwrap dough and roll into a  1/8&#34-thick round. Patch any cracks in dough but don't worry if the edges are jagged. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Fill and assemble: Fill dough with fruit leaving a 2&#34 - 3&#34 border of crust. Fold the edges of the pastry over fruit overlapping the folds as you work around the perimeter leaving the majority of the fruit exposed. Brush the crust with egg and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake the galette: Bake for about 45 minutes rotating halfway through baking until crust is golden brown and bubbly. Let cool slightly.  Make the whipped cream: Beat cream yogurt sugar and rosewater (if using) with a whisk or in a stand mixer fitted with a wire whip until soft peaks form.   Serve: Sift a little powdered sugar over galette and serve with yogurt whipped cream.    Notes: What's left: Fruit pits spent lemons.  Make the dough up to 1 day in advance keep chilled. Let stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes before rolling out.   Use any fruit you like in place of the stone fruit (apples pears berries etc).   Add a sprinkle of ground spice to the fruit such as cinnamon nutmeg or cardamom.  Reheat galette in a low oven.   
Classic French Fruit Tart,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Classic French Fruit Tart,1 (9- or 9 1/2-inch) tart,  1 1/2 ounces white or semisweet chocolate finely chopped 1 half-pint basket (6 ounces) raspberries 1 half-pint basket (6 ounces) blackberries 1 half-pint basket (5 1/2 ounces) blueberries  Vanilla Shortcrust Dough: Click here for recipe » Vanilla Bean Pastry Cream: Click here for recipe »   , A thin layer of melted white or semisweet chocolate helps the crust stay crisp by preventing the moisture in the pastry cream from soaking into the cookie like crust. Finish the top with the ripest most luscious fruit you can find. Summer berries are an obvious choice but also try slices of nectarines and plums poached pears pineapple mango or kiwi depending upon the season.  Prepare shortcrust dough and chill according to directions: Click here for recipe  »   Bake the shell: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and position a rack in the bottom third. Line the chilled tart shell with heavy-duty foil pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 20 to 22 minutes until the foil comes away from the dough easily (if it doesn"t bake another 5 to 6 minutes and check again). Remove the pan from the oven (hold the pan by the sides and not the bottom) close the oven door and lift out the foil and weights from the shell; set them aside to cool.   Return the pan to the oven to continue baking the shell for about 10 minutes then remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and check to see if any cracks have formed. If you see a crack very gently smear a tiny bit of reserved dough over the crack to patch it&#45;you need only enough to seal the opening. Return the pan to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer until the crust is a nice golden brown all over. Transfer to a rack and cool completely.  Moisture-proof the crust: Bring an inch of water to a boil in the bottom of the double boiler. Place the chocolate in the top of the double boiler off the heat. Then place the chocolate over the steaming water. Stir occasionally with the silicone or rubber spatula until the chocolate is melted and smooth. (Or melt the chocolate in the microwave-safe bowl) Scrape the melted chocolate into the cooled tart shell and use the offset spatula to spread it into a thin layer across the bottom and about  1/2-inch up the side. Chill for 10 minutes to firm the chocolate.   Fill the tart: Spoon the Vanilla Bean Pastry Cream into the tart crust and spread into an even layer. Refrigerate while you prepare the fruit. Pour the raspberries and blackberries onto the baking sheet and pick out and discard any moldy berries or debris. These berries are usually not washed as they absorb water quickly and turn to mush. Rinse the blueberries in the strainer under cold water and pat dry. In the medium bowl gently mix all of the berries together. Transfer to the tart making sure there is a nice balance of all the berries in each area of the tart.  Finish the tart: Heat the raspberry jam and water in the small saucepan over low heat until melted hot and fluid or microwave on low in the microwave-safe bowl. Do not let it boil or it will caramelize. Brush just enough of the melted jam over the tops of the berries to glaze them a bit. You don't want to overdo it; simply touch the brush to the berries to give them a shiny look. Refrigerate the tart until ready to serve.  Serving the tart: Place the tart pan on top of a large can (the 28-ounce tomato cans are good) so that the bottom balances midair as the rim falls to the counter. Use the metal spatula to transfer the tart to a serving plate or simply leave the bottom of the tart pan under the tart for support. Slice the tart with a thin and sharp knife cutting down in one quick motion rather than sawing. This tart is lovely all by itself though a spoonful of raspberry sauce is a good accompaniment.  <

The gremolata which is sprinkled on top of the finished dish is traditionally a finely chopped mixture of lemon zest garlic and parsley. For this dish orange zest is substituted for the lemon.  Place the beans in a large bowl add cold water to cover by at least 2 inches and soak in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Drain well before using. Alternatively place the beans in a saucepan add cold water to cover by 2 inches bring to a boil cover and boil for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand in the water covered for 1 hour. Drain well before using.  If new soak both portions of a 3-quart clay cooker in cold water for 30 minutes. If the pot has been used before soak both parts for only 15 minutes. Drain and pat dry before using.  Lay the lamb flat fat side up on a work surface. With a paring or boning knife trim off any large clumps of fat the butcher might have missed. Turn the lamb cut side up. Use a mortar and pestle to crush together the garlic salt rosemary and pepper to a paste. Alternatively use a garlic press to mash or a rasp grater to grate the garlic and then mash together the garlic salt rosemary and pepper in a small bowl using a fork. Measure out and reserve 2 teaspoons of the garlic mixture. Spread the remaining garlic mixture on the cut surface of the lamb.  Cut 8 lengths of cooking string each about 20 inches long or use silicone ties. Position the lamb with a long side facing you and roll it into a fat oval tucking in the edges as you roll. Position the lamb horizontally on the work surface and place 6 lengths of the string at equally spaced intervals under it. Tie each string firmly but not too tightly around the meat. Run the remaining 2 pieces of string lengthwise around the lamb and tie them in place tucking any protruding pieces of lamb under the strings.  Heat a large heavy skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil. Add the lamb and brown turning with tongs and a wide spatula for about 20 minutes or until well colored on all sides. Transfer the lamb to a plate. Add the onion and carrot and cook over medium heat stirring for 10 minutes or until golden. Add the reserved 2 teaspoons of the garlic mixture and cook for 30 seconds. Add the drained beans tomatoes bay leaves and orange zest and stir to blend.  Spoon the bean mixture into the bottom half of the soaked clay cooker. Place the lamb on top of the beans with any juices that accumulated on the plate. Add the broth.  Cover and place in a cold oven. Turn the oven to 450&deg;F. Bake without disturbing for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and let stand covered for 20 minutes.  Make the gremolata: On a cutting board finely chop the parsley orange zest and garlic together with a knife or chop them together in a food processor. Set aside.  Using oven mitts lift the lid from the clay cooker. Use a wide spatula and tongs to transfer the meat to a cutting board. Tent the meat with aluminum foil. Taste the beans and add salt and pepper if needed. Remove the bay leaves. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the beans to a deep platter and tent with foil to keep warm. Transfer the excess juices in the clay cooker to a saucepan and boil for 3 minutes until reduced slightly.  Remove the strings or ties from the meat. Carve the meat into  3/4-inch-thick slices and arrange the slices on top of the beans. Spoon the reduced juices over the top. Sprinkle the gremolata evenly on top and serve.

(Be careful here&mdash;the mixture will rise dramatically in the pan and sputter.) Stir with the wooden spoon or the spatula to blend. If any bits of caramel have solidified set the pan back over very low heat and stir gently until they melt. Cool the caramel to room temperature. Add more salt to taste.  4. To prepare crisp topping: In a bowl stir together the flour oats brown sugar cinnamon and salt. Add the butter blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal.  5. To bake the crisp: In a large bowl toss the apples with the lemon juice granulated sugar cooled caramel and corn starch and transfer the mixture to 9-inch cast iron skillet. Crumble the topping evenly over the apple mixture and bake the crisp in the middle of preheated oven until the apples are cooked through and the top is golden about 25 to 30 minutes.  6. To serve: Let the crisp stand for 10 minutes and serve it warm with the cinnamon ice cream. 
Caramel Apples,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/dessert-sauces/Caramel Apples,4 apples,  1 recipe Salted Butter Caramel (Click for recipe)  4 craft or popsicle sticks 4 large cold apples  Optional garnishes:  1/2 cup toasted chopped nuts  1/2 cup chopped chocolate  1/2 cup cocoa nibs  1/2 crushed gingersnaps  1/2 cup melted chocolate in a small piping bag for drizzling   , Tips for perfect caramel apples: Wash your apples really well. Apple producers add a thin film of edible wax to make their apples shiny; however the wax may prevent the caramel from sticking to the apple. Make sure your apples are very dry same dilemma. Chill your apples the caramel will harden onto a chilled apple quicker. We like firm tart crisp apples for dipping as a contrast to the sweet creamy caramel.  Let the hot caramel mixture sit in the bowl until the temperature cools to just below 200 degrees F at which point you are ready to dip the apples.  While the caramel sauce is cooking and cooling line a rimmed baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Insert a craft stick in the stem end of each apple. Dip an apple into the caramel coating all but the very top of the apple. Lift the apple out of the caramel and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds to allow the excess caramel to drip off. Turn the apple caramel side up and hold for several seconds to set the caramel and transfer to the baking sheet to cool. Repeat with the remaining apples. Some caramel sauce will form a little pool at the base of each apple. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Once the caramel has chilled a few minutes remove from the refrigerator and press the caramel that has pooled at the bottom of the apples up against the side of the apples.  If you are using garnishes roll the caramel apples in them now. Then return the apples to the refrigerator and chill for at least another hour.  If giving as gifts after the apples have completely chilled wrap them in plastic wrap.

Creamy Red Onion Soup with Thyme,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/soups-stews/vegetarian/Creamy Red Onion Soup with Thyme,8 servings,   1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil plus more for brushing the bread 3 pounds sweet red onions preferably Torpedo type halved lengthwise then thinly sliced crosswise 3 cloves garlic sliced Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme 1 tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour 1 1/2 quarts chicken broth (if canned use equal parts broth and water) plus more if needed 8 baguette slices about  1/2 inch thick sliced at a 45-degree angle  1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese 3 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley   , The slender elongated Torpedo red onions harvested in early summer are especially mild and sweet perfect for salads sandwiches and soups such as this one. Because they are high in moisture they don’t store well so use them within a couple of weeks. Vicki Westerhoff at Genesis Growers cultivates the prized Tropea variety a red heirloom from the southern Italian region of Calabria. Like Torpedo Tropea is a mellow onion that would shine in this soup as well. The sharp salty flavor of pecorino helps to balance the onions’ sweetness so it’s a better choice here than Parmigiano Reggiano.  Put the olive oil in a large pot over moderate heat. Add the onions and garlic and stir to coat them with the oil. Season well with salt. Cook stirring often until the onions become very soft and creamy about 1 hour. They will throw some liquid at first but after the liquid evaporates they will begin to caramelize. Lower the heat if the onions threaten to stick to the bottom of the pan.  Just before the onions are ready prepare a moderately hot charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium-high (375 3/4 to 400&deg;F).  When the onions are ready add the thyme and flour and cook stirring for about 2 minutes. Then add the broth and bring to a simmer stirring. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook for 15 minutes to blend the flavors. Season with pepper and more salt if needed.  To give the soup extra body puree about 2 cups of it (broth and onions) in a food processor or blender until smooth then stir the puree back into the soup.  Brush the baguette slices on both sides with olive oil. Grill the bread on both sides directly over the coals or gas flame until golden brown.  Reheat the soup to serve. Divide it among warmed soup bowls. Float a grilled baguette slice on each portion and sprinkle each slice with 1 tablespoon grated cheese. Garnish with the parsley. Serve immediately.

Lemon Mascarpone Layer Cake,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Lemon Mascarpone Layer Cake,1 cake,  1 recipe Lemon Curd click here  Sponge Cakes: 6 large eggs separated 7 tablespoons plus 7 tablespoons sugar 1 3/4 cups sifted cake flour  Lemon Syrup:  1/2 cup sugar  1/2 cup water  1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice  Mascarpone Filling: 2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream 7 tablespoons sugar 1 pound mascarpone   , This soft moist towering cloud of a dessert lies somewhere between a cake and a trifle its lemon syrup–soaked cake layers alternating with lemon mascarpone cream. Perfect for entertaining the cake is at its best the day after you assemble it when the flavors and textures have had a chance to blend and mellow. Meyer lemons are especially fragrant but this cake is outstanding with supermarket Eureka lemons as well. There are a few steps here but almost everything can be done ahead which makes putting it together pretty easy-check the notes at the end of the recipe.   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and position oven racks in the lower and upper thirds. Fit each cake pan with a parchment round. Do not grease the pans.  Make the cakes: Whip the egg yolks and 7 tablespoons of the sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer on high speed until thick and very light in color 4 to 5 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl although you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside while you whip the egg whites.  In the cleaned mixer bowl with the cleaned whisk attachment or in the cleaned medium bowl with clean beaters whip the egg whites on medium speed to soft peaks. With the mixer running gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons of sugar; continue beating until the egg whites hold firm peaks. Fold one-third of the egg whites into the beaten yolks with the spatula then use the fine-mesh strainer to sift half of the flour over the top and gently fold it in. Repeat. Fold in the last of the egg whites until no streaks of white remain.  Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes until the tops are golden firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean. Halfway through the baking time switch the pans on the racks so they bake evenly. Transfer the cakes to a rack to cool completely.  Make the lemon syrup: Heat the sugar and water in the small saucepan stirring occasionally until the sugar has completely dissolved and  Make the mascarpone filling: Place the cream and sugar in the cleaned mixer bowl and whip until soft peaks form. Place the mascarpone and 1 cup lemon curd in a large bowl and stir until blended-it should be the consistency of pudding. Gently fold in the whipped cream until the mixture is homogenous and thick. If the mixture becomes overworked it will look grainy or separated. If this happens stir in several tablespoons of cream with the spatula and stir just until the mixture has smoothed out again. Transfer 2 3/4 cups of filling to a medium bowl to use for piping decorations. Transfer half of the remaining filling to another medium bowl. Refrigerate all 3 bowls of mascarpone mixture. You may want to label the three bowls: one for piping one for filling layers and one for frosting.   Unmold the cakes: Run the thin flexible knife or spatula around the edge of a pan to loosen a cake. Turn the pan upside down and give it a sharp rap on the table to release (don't worry these cakes are very sturdy). Turn the cake right side up leaving the parchment paper attached. Repeat with the remaining cake. Level the cakes if necessary (see page 308). Using the serrated knife slice each cake horizontally into two layers (see page 308). Set aside one of the bottom layers to use last and remove the parchment from the other layer.  Assemble the cake: Place a cake layer cut side up on the cake cardboard or serving plate. Brush the cake with  3/4 of the lemon syrup. With the icing spatula spread  1/3 of the mascarpone filling on top. Place 3 level tablespoons of the remaining lemon curd on top of the filling and spread evenly to the edge.  Place a second cake layer on top cut side up and repeat with lemon syrup mascarpone filling and lemon cur

Simply combine the dry ingredients in one bowl the liquid in another then mix the two and fold in the raspberries. If you measure everything out the night before these can be tossed together in no time even on a weekday morning. They’re a great project for kids.  Preheat the oven to 400°F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat a standard 12-cup muffin pan with melted butter oil or high-heat canola oil spray. Place the flour  2/3 cup of the sugar the baking powder baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to blend thoroughly.  In a medium skillet melt the butter with the lemon zest (this will help to bring out the flavor of the zest and distribute it evenly in the batter). Turn off the heat. Add the buttermilk and let it sit for 1 to 2 minutes just until it is tepid. Pour the liquid into a medium bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Whisk until well blended.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the liquid ingredients into the well. Mix only until there are no more streaks of flour or pools of liquid and the batter looks smooth. A few small lumps scattered throughout are fine&#45;they will disappear during baking. Gently fold in the raspberries until evenly distributed.  Use a large ice-cream scoop or 2 soupspoons to divide the batter evenly into the prepared muffin cups. Stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and the cinnamon and sprinkle it over the tops of the muffins.  Bake the muffins for 18 to 20 minutes until the tops feel firm and a skewer inserted into the centers comes out clean. Transfer the muffin pan to a rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Gently run a knife or spatula around each muffin to free it from the pan lift the muffins out and transfer them to the rack to finish cooling (careful these are tender while hot). Serve warm or at room temperature.

Your favorite summer veggies take center stage in this raw dish. When shaved thinly vegetables that you might not normally eat raw present new possibilities. Long straight-sided summer squashes like green and yellow zucchini look like wide ribbons when shaved for this salad. A brief rest in a garlicky vinaigrette renders them supple so they can be tossed with arugula and shavings of salty cheese. Zephyr squash a straightneck variety would be ideal for this recipe because each squash has both yellow and green markings.   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.   Toast the almonds on a baking sheet until golden brown and fragrant 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool.  Trim the ends of the zucchini. With a mandoline or other manual vegetable slicer or a vegetable peeler shave the zucchini thinly lengthwise. Discard the first and last slices of each squash which are mostly skin. Put the zucchini ribbons in a large bowl.  In a small bowl whisk together the olive oil lemon juice garlic and salt to taste. Add the dressing to the shaved zucchini and toss with your hands to coat it evenly. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Let stand for 5 minutes to allow the zucchini to soften.  Add the arugula to the zucchini. With a cheese plane or vegetable peeler shave about 3 ounces of cheese or as much as you like into the bowl. Add several grinds of black pepper then toss gently with your hands. Transfer the salad to a serving platter leaving any watery juices behind. Top with the toasted almonds. Serve immediately.

Vanilla Bean Pastry Cream,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/dessert-sauces/Vanilla Bean Pastry Cream,about 2 cups,  1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) whole milk 1 vanilla bean (or 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract) 1 large egg 2 large egg yolks 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) sugar  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) cold unsalted butter   , A classic filling for fresh fruit tarts eclairs and cream pies pastry cream is really just a flour-thickened custard sauce which also means that it can take on a near-endless variety of flavorings from spices and citrus to chocolates and liqueurs.   Fill the large bowl halfway with ice and water and set it aside. Pour the milk into the medium saucepan. Use the tip of a paring knife to cut the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Turn the knife over and use the dull side to scrape the seeds into the saucepan then add the pod. Heat until the mixture just begins to simmer. Remove from the heat and let steep for 30 minutes. (If using vanilla extract instead of a vanilla bean skip this step and add the extract later.)  Heat the milk to just below the boiling point and remove from the heat. In a medium bowl whisk together the egg egg yolks and sugar until well blended and smooth. Add the flour and whisk vigorously until the mixture is very smooth. Pour about  1/2 cup of the hot milk into the yolk mixture whisking constantly to temper the yolks. Slowly pour the yolk mixture back into the hot milk whisking all the while.  Heat the mixture whisking constantly to prevent the flour from lumping until it reaches a boil. Continue to cook and whisk for another minute until the pastry cream is very thick. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter (and vanilla extract if using). Strain the pastry cream through the strainer set over a medium bowl to remove any lumps or tiny bits of egg. (Save the vanilla bean: Rinse it thoroughly allow to dry then use it to make vanilla sugar).  Press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pastry cream then set the bowl into the bowl of ice water. Once the pastry cream has completely cooled use or store in the refrigerator until needed.

Apricot Vanilla Bean Preserves with Rose,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/breakfast/jams-preserves/Apricot Vanilla Bean Preserves with Rose,2 (1-pint) jars or 4 (8-ounce) jars,  6 cups pitted chopped ripe apricots 3 cups granulated sugar  1/2 cup Rose wine 4 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste 1 tablespoon unsalted butter   , Preserving apricots with vanilla and wine plays up the flavor of apricots beautifully without overpowering the fruit.  Place a couple small plates in the freezer these will be used to test the preserves later. In an 8-quart heavy bottomed stainless steel pot add all the preserve ingredients. Place pot on the stove over medium-high heat and cook stirring regularly until the mixture comes to a boil. Skim off the pale yellow foam that forms at the top and discard. Stir the preserves frequently to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.  After about 25 minutes begin testing the preserves by placing a small amount on a cold plate. Transfer the plate to the freezer for several minutes. If the cooled preserve is the desired consistency then it is ready for final processing. If not cook a few more minutes and check again.  To process jars: Ladle boiling water from the canning pot into the bowl with the lids. Using a jar lifter remove the sterilized jars from the canning pot carefully pouring the water from each one back into the pot and place them upright on a folded towel. Drain the water off the jar lids.  Ladle the hot preserves into the jars leaving  3/4-inch headspace at the top. Use a damp paper towel to wipe the rims of the jars and place flat lid and band on each jar. Tighten bands just finger-tight. Return the jars to the water in the canning pot making sure the water covers the jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil and boil for 8 minutes to process.   Transfer the jars to a folded towel and do not disturb for 12 hours. After 2 hours check that the lids have sealed by pressing down on the center; if the lid gives and makes a clicking sound when pressed it hasn't sealed and the jar should be refrigerated immediately. Sealed jars can be labeled and stored in a dark and cool place.

Thai Fried Rice,by Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/cuisine/global/Thai Fried Rice,4 servings,   1 tablespoon Thai fish sauce  1 teaspoon soy sauce  1 teaspoon water  1 teaspoon white sugar  4 cups cooked and chilled jasmine rice  1 tablespoon peanut or vegetable oil  2 large eggs lightly beaten 3 ounces thinly sliced pancetta chopped  4 scallions white and green parts thinly sliced reserved separately  1 large shallot minced (4 tablespoons)   1 garlic clove minced   3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro  Sliced cucumber and lime wedges to serve   , We liked the aromatic flavor of jasmine rice but long-grain white or basmati works too. It's important to use chilled rice (which can be made up to a day ahead of time). A good Thai fish sauce was essential; at Milk Street we use Red Boat. Pork belly is traditional in this recipe but that can be hard to find in the U.S. Pancetta worked well as a substitute; it has the right amount of salt and fat. Plain bacon will do the job too but avoid smoked bacon.  Don't use hot or warm rice. The fried rice will turn out clumpy and gummy.  In a bowl stir together the fish sauce soy sauce water and sugar. Set aside. Use your hands to break up the rice so no clumps remain. Set aside.  Heat a wok over medium-high until a drop of water evaporates within 1 to 2 seconds of contact about 3 minutes. Swirl in the oil then pour in the eggs. Cook stirring until just set. Transfer the eggs to a plate. Add the pancetta to the wok and cook over medium stirring occasionally until crisp about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon transfer to the plate with the eggs.  Return the wok to medium-high until just smoking. Add the scallion whites shallot and garlic then using a metal spatula stir-fry until softened about 1 minute. Add the rice and stir-fry until heated through about 2 minutes.  Stir the fish sauce mixture to recombine then pour in a thin stream along the sides of the wok. Stir-fry until well mixed. Stir in the pancetta egg (breaking up the egg) and cilantro. Transfer to a large platter and sprinkle with scallion greens. Serve with cucumber and lime wedges.

Mile-High Apple Pie,Simple Comforts: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/Mile-High Apple Pie,8 servings,  Pie Dough: 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon salt 10 tablespoons (1 3/4 sticks) cold unsalted butter cut into tablespoons 6 ounces cream cheese (not lowfat) at room temperature cut into  3/4-inch pieces  Filling: 4 pounds Golden Delicious apples 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter  1/2 cup plus 1 teaspoon sugar 3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon heavy cream or whole milk   , The attractive high dome of an apple pie can be considered a ruse as the apples have shrunk leaving a big space between the filling and the crust. Precooking the apples will minimize the gap and concentrate the apple flavor too. Cream cheese pie dough makes assembling the pastry a breeze.  To make the dough:  Put the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse briefly to combine them. Scatter the butter and cream cheese over the top and pulse about 12 times or just until the dough begins to clump together (butter pieces will still be visible). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gather it together.  Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled but not hard 1 to 2 hours.  To make the filling: Peel and quarter the apples and cut out the core from each quarter. Cut each quarter lengthwise into thirds and place in a large bowl. As you add the slices to the bowl occasionally sprinkle and toss the apples with lemon juice. (Don't wait until all the apples are cut or the first slices will have already turned brown.)  In a large skillet melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add half the apples and  3/4 cup of the sugar. Cook stirring often for about 7 minutes or until the apples are barely tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Transfer to a large bowl or rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter the second half of the apples and another  3/4 cup sugar. If your skillet is smaller than 12 inches cook the apples in three batches. Let the filling cool completely stirring occasionally. Sprinkle the flour and cinnamon over the cooled filling and toss well.  Position a rack in the center of the oven and place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  To make the pie: Lightly flour a work surface and draw a 12- inch circle in the flour. This guide will be the perfect size for a standard 9-inch pie dish. Place 1 dough disk in the center of the circle and dust a little flour on top. Using the circle as a guide roll out the dough into a 12-inch round about  1/8 inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over the pie dish and carefully unroll the round over a 9-inch pie dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Fill with the apples. Trim the overhanging dough to  1/2 inch. Roll out the remaining pie dough into a second 12-inch round. Transfer the dough round the same way centering it over the apple filling. Fold the overhang of the upper round under the edge of the bottom crust. Pinch the crusts together and flute the edge attractively. Cut a small hole in the center of the pie to allow steam to escape. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Lightly brush the top crust with the cream. Sprinkle the top crust with the remaining teaspoon of sugar.  Baking and serving: Place the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake for 40 to 50 minutes until the top is golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour. Serve warm or at room temperature.   
Tangerine-Champagne Sorbet,David Lebovitz,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Tangerine-Champagne Sorbet,1 quart,  3 cups (750ml) freshly squeezed tangerine juice from 4 pounds (1.9kg) tangerines  2/3 cup (140g) granulated sugar 1 cup (250 ml) Champagne or sparkling wine   , "Most people associate Christmas in Paris with luxe items specifically oysters foie gras Champagne and chocolate. But no feast is complete until the clementines come out: shiny bowls of little orange citrus often festooned with their leaves.  From the start of clementine season which begins in late fall Parisians make the rounds of the outdoor markets going from stand to stand tasting the samples that vendors peel and put on plates to find the sweetest specimens out there. Most vendors use their fingers to peel the tangerines but a few use their teeth to rip away the skin. (I avoid tasting those particular ones.) Of all the things people associate with winter in Paris-the lavish department store windows people buying Champagne by the case lugs of fresh oysters sold on the sidewalks butchers offering creamy slabs of pate de foie gras-I look forward to those clementines the most. And it's impossible not to get caught up in the fruit frenzy at the market with shoppers and vendors loading up big bags to carry home and no one leaves with less than a few pounds.  Of course my responsibility every year for Christmas is the final course and one year I made a dessert that had everyone stunned: a Champagne jelly with supremes (carefully cut sections with no membranes) of pink grapefruit tangerines navel oranges and thin strips of candied orange peel festively served in Champagne glasses with a scoop of icy-cold tangerine-Champagne sorbet perched on top. It's a wonderful do-ahead dessert that goes especially well after winter dishes like cassoulet (page 195) or Counterfeit duck confit (page 179)." &#8211Reprinted with permission from My Paris Kitchen by David Lebovitz copyright &#169; 2014. Published by Ten Speed Press an imprint of Random House LLC.  In a large saucepan over low heat warm  1/2 cup (125ml) of the tangerine juice with the sugar stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 1/2 cups (625ml) of tangerine juice. Add the Champagne. Transfer to a container and chill thoroughly.  Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Note that this will not freeze as hard as other sorbets because of the alcohol in the Champagne. However it will make it more scoopable once fully frozen.  Variations: If you wish to serve this with Champagne gelee soften 2 envelopes (14g) of unflavored gelatin by sprinkling over  1/2 cup (125ml) of cold water in a very large bowl and letting sit for 5 minutes. In a small saucepan heat  1/2 cup (125ml) of water with 1 cup (200g) of sugar until the sugar is dissolved then pour it over the gelatin and stir well. Add 1 bottle of Champagne or sparkling wine (it will foam up so pour it slowly) and a squeeze of lemon or lime juice. Pour the mixture into a smaller container and chill until firm at least 6 hours.  To serve spoon some of the chilled gelee in wine goblets breaking it up into bite-size mounds. Garnish with fresh orange tangerine or grapefruit segments or a combination of them. Top with a scoop of tangerine-Champagne sorbet. Duck fat cookies (page 297) make a snappy accompaniment. Tangerine-Champagne sorbet is also good with a spoonful of warm sabayon made with either Champagne or a sweet dessert wine such as Sauternes. Make the sabayon by whisking together  2/3 cup (165ml) of Sauternes with  1/3 cup (60g) of sugar and 6 large egg yolks in a large bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Continue whisking until the mixture becomes foamy. Keep whisking until it thickens; when you lift the whisk the mixture should hold its shape when it falls back onto the surface.

Green Chile Tamales,Cuisinart,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Green Chile Tamales,24 tamales,  Green Chile: 2 pounds poblano peppers 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion peeled and finely chopped 1 jalape&#241;o pepper seeded and finely chopped 4 garlic cloves finely chopped 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon unbleached all-purpose flour 2 cups chicken broth low sodium 2 pounds whole chicken legs (about 4 legs) roasted meat removed and shredded 24 corn husks  Masa Dough: 5 cups masa harina 3 3/4 cups water 1 3/4 cups vegetable oil 1 tablespoon plus one teaspoon baking powder 2 1/2 teaspoons sea or kosher salt 2 quarts water for steaming  , Prepare the green chile: Line the cooking pot of the Multicooker with the poblano peppers. Cover and set to Brown/Saute at 400 degrees F. Cook for about 30 minutes removing cover to turn every 8 to 10 minutes until all sides are charred (time will vary depending on the size and quantity of the peppers). Remove put into a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Once cool to the touch peel seed and roughly chop. Reserve. Carefully clean any of the char from the bottom of the pot before using for the next step.  Put oil into the cooking pot and again set to Brown/Saute at 400 degrees F. When the oil is hot add the onion jalape&#241;o and garlic to the pot. Stir and saute until softened and slightly golden. Stir in the flour and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the broth using a nonstick whisk and bring to simmer until smooth and thickened (about 5 to 7 minutes). Stir in the chicken and the reserved chopped poblanos and switch to Slow Cook on High for 3 hours.  While the chile is cooking pour boiling water over the corn husks to soak. Use an inverted plate to keep the husks submerged for up to 1 hour.  Remove the finished chile from the cooking pot. It should be moist not soupy. If necessary transfer to a strainer to remove any excess liquid. Allow cooking pot to cool enough to handle and clean. Replace in the unit to steam tamales.   Prepare the masa: In a large bowl using a hand mixer mix together the masa water oil baking powder and salt.  Assemble tamales: Drain and rinse corn husks and lay flat. Hold one in your hand and spread about  3/4 cup of masa dough onto the husk. You want to cover 2/3 of the husk toward the wider end. Place about 2 to 4 tablespoons of chile on top of the masa (this will differ depending on the size of the corn husks). Fold the narrow end of the husk up into the tamale and then roll the sides together to enclose.   Repeat with remaining tamales  Fill multicooker pot with 2 quarts of water and set the unit to Steam fitted with the steaming rack. Place 12 of the tamales onto the rack and set timer to 1 1/2 hours. Check after 1 hour has passed – the husk should easily peel away from the side and the masa should be set. Repeat this step making sure that there are 2 quarts of water in the cooking pot and steam the remaining tamales.  Note:Masa harina is flour made from the dried corn dough used to make tortillas and can be found in specialty food stores or in the international aisle of most supermarkets. 
Black Duck with Black Trumpet Mushroom Soil Black Garlic Puree and Blackened Long Carrots,DeLille Cellars,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Black Duck with Black Trumpet Mushroom Soil Black Garlic Puree and Blackened Long Carrots,1 serving,  Black Garlic Puree: 1 garlic clove (black peeled)  1 teaspoon lemongrass (tender white bulb only crushed and minced)  1 teaspoon fresh ginger (minced)  1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon grape seed oil 2 to 3 tablespoons coconut milk 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons water  Black Trumpet Mushroom Soil: 1 package of dried black trumpet mushrooms 1 teaspoon coffee flour 1 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon water   Duck Breasts: 2 duck breasts 4 twigs of thyme Salt and pepper  Blackened Long Carrots: 8 long carrots 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons butter 3 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon cumin seed Salt and pepper   , This dish is so delicious that Jason Wilson's Crush Restaurant featured it on their menu for a month paired with our DeLille Cellars 2012 Four Flags Cabernet.  The idea is for the mushroom soil to soak up the duck juices along with the black garlic puree to produce a whole array of savory flavors.  I have felt for some time now that of all the meats and poultry duck breasts are best Sous Vide.  However if this is unavailable to you you can certainly pan sear the duck with the same seasoning on medium high heat.  To make the Black Garlic Puree: add all ingredients into a food processor or blender and puree. Set aside.  To make the Black Trumpet Mushroom Soil: put dried mushrooms coffee flour and sugar into a food processor or coffee grinder and grind. Transfer to a small bowl and add water. Stir until it has the appearance of dirt.  To make the Duck Breasts: pat the duck breasts dry and season with salt and pepper. Place a twig of fresh thyme on each breast and place in a vacuum sealed bag. Seal and Sous Vide at 135 degrees F for roughly an hour. Remove breasts and mark and sear them at 500 degrees F on a grill or a very hot pan (about 30 seconds per side). Cut each breast in half length-wise and then slice each for 4 portions.  To make the Blackened Long Carrots: while the duck is cooking in a large pan at medium-high heat saute the carrots in the oil for about 10 minutes (or when they start to soften and turn color). Add the butter cumin and honey. The carrots should start to caramelize and darken. Add salt and Pepper to taste.  To Serve: simply sprinkle the mushroom soil on 4 plates.  Place each duck breast half over the soil and zig-zag the black garlic puree on top.  Complement with the carrots on the side.   
Basic Fresh Masa Preparada,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Basic Fresh Masa Preparada,about 3 dozen tamales,  1  1/3 cups lard or unsalted butter at room temperature 1  1/2 teaspoons sea salt 1  1/2 teaspoons baking powder 3 pounds fresh masa (not "masa preparada" which already includes lard and flavorings) 2 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth plus more as needed   For assembling tamales:  1 bag soaked corn husks Filling of your choice    , In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment place the butter or lard with salt and baking powder (if using) and whip on high speed until fluffy about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and add the fresh masa alternating with 2 cups of broth. Beat until well mixed. (Depending on the capacity of your mixer you may need to do this in two batches.)  Increase mixer speed to medium-high and whip until masa resembles the consistency of soft yet workable dough about 3 minutes. If the dough is too firm add more broth  3/4 cup at a time until the correct consistency is attained.   To assemble the tamales: lay the corn husk flat rough side down and the tip pointing away from you. If it’s a small husk place two together overlapping them a bit. Spread about  1/3 cup masa preparada in the center of the bottom part of the husk using moistened fingers or the back of a spoon smooth dough to about a  1/3-inch thickness. Top with 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling of your choice. Fold the two long sides of the husk towards the middle so that the masa forms a tube around the filling. Fold the pointed tip of the husk down over the filled section. The filling end will be exposed but the masa will set and protect it during steaming.  To steam the tamales: Add 2 cups water and the steamer insert to the pressure cooker.  Working in batches stack tamales vertically inside the cooker with the open end up and pressure cook for 15 minutes.  If husk does not peel away easily pressure cook for 5 to 10 minutes more until tamales are cooked through.

Line the baking sheets with parchment paper.  In the bowl of the stand mixer combine the dough  3/4 cup of the cheese the mustard and black pepper. Mix on low just until evenly blended.  Spoon 1-inch rounds of the dough onto the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart. In a small bowl lightly beat the egg to blend thoroughly. Brush a light coating of egg over the tops of the rounds being careful that it does not drip down the sides (it will glue the dough to the parchment). You will not use all the egg. Sprinkle each round with a little of the remaining  3/4 cup cheese.  Bake the gougeres for 20 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 350&deg;F switch the sheets between the racks rotate each pan from front to back and bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer until the gougeres are a deep golden brown and no bubbling moisture is visible around the sides of each shape. Transfer to a rack to cool briefly. Serve the gougeres warm piled on a platter for guests to help themselves.  Storing: Baked gougeres may be stored airtight at room temperature for up to 3 days. Before serving warm and crisp them for 7 to 9 minutes in a 375 degrees F oven until the outside crust is crisp and the interior is heated through.

Spent Coffee Short Rib Chili,Recipe courtesy of Scraps,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Spent Coffee Short Rib Chili,6 servings  Learn more about Scraps ,  1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 2  1/2 pounds boneless beef short ribs Coarse sea salt 3 medium yellow onions peeled and chopped 2 tablespoons chili powder 2 tablespoons ground cumin 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 1 star anise  1/2 cup brandy 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes 2 tablespoons spent coffee grounds 1 quart chicken stock homemade or bought 1  1/2 cups French brown lentils 1 cup packaged fried shallots (get them at any Asian grocery or online)  2 cups shredded sharp white cheddar cheese   , Imagine how many cups of coffee are brewed every single morning and every one of those cups results in a couple of tablespoons of used coffee grounds. The aroma of coffee is intoxicating and it’s still there even after the beans are spent. I love their roasted chocolate notes with assertive red meats like the short ribs in this chili.   Get the oil hot in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the short ribs with a good amount of salt. Brown the meat on all sides for about 3 minutes per side. Don’t crowd the pot. If the pieces of meat touch they will steam and not brown. Remove them and continue browning the rest of the short ribs. Remove onto the pot lid turned upside down to catch the juices.  Add the onions to the Dutch oven and cook until they start to brown about 5 minutes. Stir when it looks like they could use stirring.  Stir in the ground spices brown sugar and star anise and cook until the smell of the spices is strong a minute or so.  Add the brandy. Stand back as the brandy could flame. If it does cover with a lid to douse the flames. Another lid not the one holding the short ribs. Cook until the pot is almost dry. Add the tomatoes with their juices. Add the spent coffee grounds stock short ribs and any accumulated juices. Cover and simmer over low heat until the meat is fork-tender about 2 1/2 hours.  Stir in the lentils and continue to simmer covered until the lentils are tender about 30 minutes.  Remove the short ribs from the chili. Using two forks shred the meat into bite-size pieces. Stir back into the chili. Serve garnished with the fried shallots and cheese.  
White Chocolate–Lime Creme Caramel,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/White Chocolate–Lime Creme Caramel,6 servings,  Custard: 2 cups (16 ounces) whole milk 3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) sugar Grated zest of 3 limes 3 large eggs 6 ounces white chocolate finely chopped  Caramel Lining:  1/2 cup (4 ounces) water 1 cup (7 ounces) sugar  3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar  Candied lime zest and Softly Whipped Cream for serving   , Whether you call it flan cr&egrave;me caramel or cr&egrave;me renversee it's hard to resist a creamy custard turned upside down and served in a pool of liquid caramel. The flavors of cr&egrave;me caramel are always more complex than regular custard because of the caramel that surrounds it during baking and chilling which adds a layer of flavor beyond the custard itself. A measure of white chocolate gives this one a lovely texture while the lime and caramel work in tandem to cut the sweetness of the chocolate. Though this is a classic crème caramel with whole milk and eggs only the white chocolate makes it taste richer and creamier.  Make and flavor the custard: Heat the milk sugar and lime zest in the medium saucepan over low heat just until the mixture begins to simmer. Remove from the heat cover and allow to steep for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until the lime flavor is strong. You can even leave the mixture to steep overnight in the refrigerator if you like.  Make the caramel lining: Pour the water into the small saucepan and add the sugar and cream of tartar. Cook over medium heat stirring constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the liquid is clear. Increase the heat to high and boil rapidly swirling the pan occasionally (without stirring) to cook the sugar evenly until the caramel turns a deep golden brown. Remove from the heat and immediately divide the caramel among the custard cups swirling each cup to distribute the still-liquid caramel evenly up the sides. Be careful to go only about halfway up the sides. The caramel is very hot and you don't want it to drip off the edge of a cup and onto your skin. You may want to keep a small bowl of ice water nearby in case a bit of caramel touches your skin. Set the caramel-lined cups in the roasting pan making sure they don't touch and let them cool for 10 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center.  Temper the eggs: Place the saucepan with the lime-infused milk mixture back over medium heat uncover and reheat just until it begins to simmer. Whisk the eggs in the medium bowl. Twist a damp kitchen towel into a rope and wrap it around the bottom of the bowl to secure it while you temper the eggs. Pour about  1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture into the eggs whisking constantly. Once blended whisk in another  1/2 cup. Then slowly pour the rest of the mixture into the eggs whisking constantly. Add the white chocolate and whisk until melted and blended completely.  Strain and bake the custard: Pour the mixture through the strainer into the pitcher and discard the zest. Divide the warm custard among the cups in the pan. Pull out the oven rack and place the pan on the rack. Remove one of the cups pour enough hot tap water (not boiling) into that area to come halfway up the sides of the cups and replace the cup. Cut a piece of foil large enough to fit just inside the edges of the roasting pan then lay the foil across the top of the cups making sure it doesn't touch the custard. You may need to smooth and flatten the foil on the counter if any wrinkles touch the custard. Gently push the rack back into the oven shut the oven door and bake the custards for 30 to 40 minutes until they are just set and their centers are no longer wobbly (test by gently tapping the side of the pan with a spoon).  Remove the foil and then the pan from the oven being careful not to tilt the pan and splash water on top of the custards. Set the pan on a heatproof surface. Use a pair of tongs (or your hand protected by a kitchen towel) to immediately remove the cups from the water bath and place them on a rack to cool to room temperature about 40 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold at least 4 hours or overnight.  Unmold the custards: Run a mini-spatula or a thin flexible knife inside the edge of a cup pressing the knife into

Although nearly any frosting pairs well with this celebration favorite it is especially luscious filled and frosted with silken chocolate ganache for the two-toned birthday cake most of us remember from childhood. For a special party or tea make the mini cupcakes variation at the end of the recipe (shown at left) then top them with swirls of Cream Cheese Frosting and finish them with pretty Sugared Flowers and/or touches of gold leaf.  Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat the pan with melted butter oil or high-heat canola-oil spray and fit it with a round of parchment paper.  Cream the butter with the sugar: Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer and beat on medium until very light&#45;almost white&#45;in color 4 to 5 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl although you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape down the bowl with the spatula.  Add the eggs: Beat the eggs and vanilla in the small bowl to blend. With the mixer on medium add the eggs to the butter mixture about 1 tablespoon at a time allowing each addition to completely blend in before adding the next. About halfway through turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl then resume adding the eggs. Scrape down the bowl again.  Add the dry and wet ingredients alternately: With the fine-mesh strainer sift the cake flour baking soda and salt into the medium bowl and whisk together. With the mixer on the lowest speed add the flour mixture and the sour cream alternately beginning with one-third of the flour mixture and half the sour cream; repeat then finish with flour mixture. Scrape down the bowl and finish blending the batter by hand if necessary.  Bake the cake: Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.  Unmold the cake: Run the thin and flexible knife or spatula around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake. Place the cardboard on top of the pan hold both together and flip over. Remove the pan leaving the parchment on the cake. Flip again onto a second cake cardboard (or a plate) so the cake is right side up. Level the cake if necessary. Using a serrated knife slice the cake horizontally into two layers.  Assemble and frost the cake: Place the cake cardboard (or plate) on your work surface. Flip the top layer of cake over and place it cut side up on the cardboard&#45;this will be the bottom of the cake.

Fresh Pasta Dough,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/breads/dough/Fresh Pasta Dough,4 servings,  2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) "00" flour plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt 4 large eggs 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil    ,  Fresh pasta dough is so easy to make you'll wonder why you never did before. If you can find Italian "00" flour use it to make very delicate yet chewy pasta. If not bread flour works really well.   To make dough: Place flour and salt in a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Make a "well" in the center of the flour mixture and add eggs and oil. Using your fingers blend the eggs into the flour mixture stirring the flour in from the sides of the well and working outwards. When the pasta dough is thoroughly mixed turn it out on a lightly floured work surface. Knead dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky adding small amounts of flour as needed; about 5 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest for at least 20 minutes or up to an hour at room temperature.  To roll dough: Secure a pasta machine to the edge of a long countertop. Using a bench scraper cut the dough into three pieces. Keep extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with one piece. With a rolling pin roll the piece of dough into a rough rectangle so that it will fit inside the widest setting of the pasta machine. Roll the dough through the machine catching it with one hand as you roll with the other. Take the dough and trifold it like a letter. Turn the dough so one open end faces the machine and roll it through on the widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting.   Continue rolling the pasta through the machine without folding adjusting the rollers to a smaller setting each time until the desired thickness is reached. If the pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.  Cut sheets to desired shapes and sizes toss with semolina flour and set aside covered with a clean kitchen towel. The pasta can be cooked immediately or covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use.   To cook pasta: Heat a large pot of water over high heat until boiling. Generously season water with salt. Add pasta and stir immediately to prevent the strands from sticking together. Boil until al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve about a cup of pasta water and drain pasta through a colander. Toss hot pasta with your sauce of choice using reserved pasta water to thin the mixture and coat the pasta as needed. Garnish as desired and serve immediately.

Rich Breakfast Dough,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/dough/Rich Breakfast Dough,about 1 1/2 pounds,   1/2 cup (4 ounces) warm whole milk (110&deg; to 115&deg;F)  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast or 1 1/8 teaspoons instant yeast 1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk at room temperature 2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter very soft (not melted)   , A leaner version of brioche dough this can be used for all those wonderful yeasted breakfast breads you love like sticky buns and coffee cake. Classic brioche while delicious is unnecessarily rich when paired with flavor-packed fillings and toppings. Despite the reduced amount of eggs and butter this dough is still soft and easy to work with and it bakes into a tender flavorful partner for all manner of fillings both sweet and savory.  Mix and knead the dough: Combine the warm milk and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Whisk by hand to blend well. Let the mixture sit for 5 to 10 minutes until the yeast is activated and foamy or bubbling. Add the egg and yolk and whisk by hand until well blended. Stir in the flour and salt with a silicone or rubber spatula. Attach the dough hook and knead on low speed for 2 minutes. The dough may look ragged at this point but don't worry&#45;the addition of butter will smooth it out. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 1 minute. With the mixer running add the soft butter 1 tablespoon at a time allowing each addition to blend in before adding the next. Once all the butter has been added decrease the speed to medium-low and continue to knead for 5 to 6 minutes longer until the dough looks soft and silky.  Rise the dough (first rise): Lightly butter or oil the tub or bowl scrape the dough into the tub and brush the surface of the dough with a little butter or oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cotton towel and let the dough rise until doubled 1 to 1 1/2 hours. If you are using a tub be sure to mark the starting level of the dough with a pencil or piece of tape so it's easy to tell when the dough has doubled. At this point the dough is ready to be punched down and used in your recipe of choice.  Storing: The dough can be punched down and refrigerated overnight. Wrap in plastic leaving a bit of wiggle room for when the dough continues to expand in the refrigerator or place in a bowl large enough to allow it to expand; cover with plastic wrap. (If you don't leave room for expansion the dough will burst through the plastic wrap.)

Chocolate Banana Marble Bread,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Chocolate Banana Marble Bread,1 loaf,  2 large or 3 medium very ripe bananas at room temperature  3/4 cup (2 ounces) buttermilk at room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 cups (7 ounces) sifted cake flour 1 teaspoon baking soda  3/4 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 cup (1 ounce) unsifted unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) boiling water plus more if needed 1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter softened (65&deg; to 68&deg;F) 1 cup (7 ounces) sugar 2 large eggs at room temperature lightly beaten   , Here's a banana bread that's soft tender and bursting with bananas yet not overly sweet as so many versions are. The key is an intensely bitter cocoa-powder paste added to half of the batter resulting in a deep rich chocolate flavor that pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the bananas. The two batters are marbled together producing a beautiful pattern and adding a sophisticated note to this all-American favorite. Because of the moisture that the bananas add the loaf keeps well for at least 4 to 5 days at room temperature and it freezes so well that you can put a couple of them away for unexpected visitors. Be sure the bananas are ripe and soft with plenty of black spots speckling their skins or you won't have the burst of banana flavor you want. Whirl them in the food processor for an ultra-smooth puree or mash thoroughly with a fork if you prefer.  Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat the loaf pan with melted butter or high-heat canola oil spray and line it with a piece of parchment paper that extends 1 inch beyond the long edge of both sides of the pan. Peel the bananas and place them in the bowl of the food processor. Process to a smooth puree. (Alternately mash them in a bowl using a fork.) Measure out 1 cup of the puree and transfer it to a medium bowl discarding the rest of the puree or saving it for another use. Add the buttermilk and vanilla and whisk just until blended. Set aside.  Use a fine-mesh strainer to sift the cake flour baking soda and baking powder together into a medium bowl. Whisk to blend well. Set aside. Place the cocoa powder in the small bowl. Pour the boiling water over the cocoa and stir until it forms a smooth paste&#45;it should run thickly off the spoon. If it is too thick add another tablespoon of boiling water and stir again. Set aside.  Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer. Beat on medium-high speed until the butter is very light almost white in color 4 to 5 minutes. Scrape down the bowl with a spatula. Turn the mixer to medium speed and add the eggs 1 tablespoon at a time completely blending in each addition before adding the next. About halfway through the eggs turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl with the spatula then continue adding the rest of the eggs. Scrape down the bowl again.  With the mixer running on the lowest speed add one-third of the flour mixture. Just as it is barely blended and you can still see a few patches of flour add half the banana mixture. Repeat with the remaining flour and banana mixtures ending with the flour. Scrape down the bowl and finish blending the batter by hand.  Transfer half of the batter to the second medium bowl. Add the cocoa paste and using the rubber spatula gently but thoroughly blend it into the batter.  Drop alternating spoonfuls of dark and light batters into the prepared pan then marbleize by using a spoon to gently turn the batter over in 3 places down the length of the pan.  Bake the banana bread for 55 to 65 minutes until firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. When cool remove from the pan peel off the parchment paper and cut slices by sawing gently with a serrated knife.   
Mini White Chocolate Flans,Jamie Silva A Sassy Spoon,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Mini White Chocolate Flans,1 serving,   1/2 cup white sugar 5 large eggs 1 can condensed milk 1 can evaporated milk  1/2 cup high quality white chocolate melted 1 tablespoon vanilla extract   , In a saucepan melt the sugar over medium high heat stirring constantly to prevent burning until it turns an amber color. Remove from heat and pour the caramel into the individual ramekins moving them around to coat the bottom of each one.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a bowl whisk the eggs until frothy. Add condensed milk evaporated milk melted chocolate and vanilla. Mix until all is well combined.  Divide the mixture into the caramel lined ramekins. Transfer the ramekins to a large roasting pan. Carefully fill the roasting pan with about 2 inches of hot water.  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until just set in the center. If the outer rims look set but the middle jiggles when you gently shake the pan or if you gently touch them and they bounce back they are done. Do not overcook. Carefully remove ramekins from water and place in the refrigerator to cool for 30 minutes.  Remove ramekins from refrigerator. You can enjoy straight from the ramekin or remove by cutting around the sides of each ramekin to loosen flan. Place a plate on top of each ramekin and turn over so the flan transfers onto the plate. Serve and enjoy!  
Olive Bread,Le Creuset adapted by Kristan Raines,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Olive Bread,1 serving,  4 cups (550g) all purpose or bread flour  1 teaspoon (7g) kosher salt or coarse sea salt  1 teaspoon (4g) instant yeast  1 1/2 cups (360g) warm water (between 90°F-100°F)   1 cup kalamata olives patted dry and roughly chopped  Olive or vegetable oil   , Whisk together the flour salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer or large mixing bowl. Add the water and stir on low speed with the dough hook attachment for about 1 minute (or stir with a spatula). Increase speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic about 8-10 minutes (or alternately knead by hand). Every few minutes stop the mixer and scrape the dough off the hook and sides of the bowl. When the dough appears smooth cut off a small piece and stretch it. If it stretches to the point of transparency it’s kneaded enough. If not continue kneading.  Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and cover it with a damp cloth and let rest for 30 minutes. Uncover the dough add the olives and mix on low until the olives are just incorporated.  Cover the dough again with a pot lid or plastic wrap and allow it to rise until it has doubled in size and does not spring back when you push your finger into it about 1 1/2 ― 2 hours (less if it’s hot and humid more if it’s cold).  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead about 1-2 minutes to release the gas. Shape the dough roughly into a ball cover with a clean towel and let rest for 10 minutes.  Cup your hands around the dough and shape it into a tight ball by rolling it on the work surface between your palms. Lightly brush the base of the Bread Oven with oil. Place the dough in the center of the base and cover with the lid. Allow the dough to rise again until roughly doubled in size and when poked with a finger will slowly spring back about 30-60 minutes.  During the last 15 minutes of rising time preheat oven to 450°F. When ready to bake score the bread with a sharp knife or razor making an X or a hash mark to allow the dough to expand freely. Cover and place in the hot oven.  Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes until the bread is golden brown and cooked through. It should have an internal temperature of approximately 200°F when done. Carefully remove the bread from the base and allow to cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing. 
Chicken Miso Soup,Ming Tsai &copy; 2007,home/recipes/soups-stews/meat-poultry/Chicken Miso Soup,4 servings,  1 large piece of kombu (about 5 by 6 inches or 12 by 2 inches depending on the shape purchased)  2  3/4-inch thick slices of fresh peeled ginger cut lengthwise from a 2- to 3-inch-long piece 2 cups dried bonito flakes 1/2 cup yellow miso (shinshu-miso) plus more if desired 2 chicken breasts boneless skinless chilled in freezer until firm and cut very thinly 2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions green parts only  4 cups udon noodles blanched   , Most of these ingredients can be found in Asian food stores and some specialty grocery stores. Kombu is a dark green long thick sea vegetable from the kelp family. Used frequently in Japanese cooking it is an essential ingredient of dashi a flavorful stock.  Clean the kombu by wiping it with a damp cloth. Place the kombu and ginger in a stockpot with 5 cups of cold water and heat over medium heat. Just before the water boils remove the pot from the heat. Watch carefully you don't want the water to boil or the dashi will become too strongly flavored.  Allow the mixture to stand for 5 minutes remove the kombu and return the pot to medium heat. When the broth once again nears the boiling point remove the pot from the heat and add the bonito flakes. When the flakes sink to the bottom of the pot strain the dashi through cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer.  Measure out 4 cups of dashi broth. In a medium saucepan bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat. Submerge a small strainer halfway into the broth add the miso to the broth within the strainer and whisk to combine the miso and broth. Taste and add more miso 1 tablespoon at a time if you want a deeper flavor.  Remove the strainer and add the chicken. Simmer until chicken is cooked through about 2 minutes. Add noodles and heat through. Ladle the soup into bowls garnish with scallion greens and serve.   
Buckwheat Crepes with Sauteed Apples and Gruyere Cheese,Things Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Marie Simmons photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/breakfast/pancakes-french-toast-waffles/Buckwheat Crepes with Sauteed Apples and Gruyere Cheese,4 to 6 servings,  Cr&#234;pe Batter: 1 cup buckwheat flour  1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon coarse salt 2 large eggs 1 1/2 cups water 2 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter melted filling 4 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter  Cr&#234;pe Filling: 3 yellow onions cut into 1⁄8-inch wedges 6 slightly green golden Delicious apples quartered cored and cut into 1⁄8-inch wedges 2 ounces smoked ham thinly slivered (optional) 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1⁄8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Pinch of coarse salt 1 tablespoon salted or unsalted butter melted plus 2 tablespoons softened 3 cups (12 ounces) coarsely grated gruyere or comte cheese   , Throughout France you will find small restaurants often tucked away on side streets specializing in cr&#234;pes. In Brittany the cr&#234;pes are made with buckwheat flour and the typical filling is a smear of salted butter cheese ham or bacon thinly sliced fruit and/or eggs. In most of France cr&#234;pes are rolled up or folded into half or quarter circles but in Brittany where they are sometimes called galettes they are folded differently. The filling is spread in the center of the pancake the four rounded sides are folded in over the filling forming a square and then the cr&#234;pe is inverted onto a serving plate.  Make the cr&#234;pe batter: in a large bowl stir together the buckwheat flour all-purpose flour and salt. in a small bowl whisk the eggs until well blended; stir in the water and butter. Gradually whisk the egg mixture into the flour mixture until the batter is smooth. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream. If it is too thick whisk in additional water 1 tablespoon at a time.  While the batter is resting prepare the filling: in a large skillet melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the onions increase the heat to medium and cook stirring for 5 minutes. Add the apples and cook stirring for 10 to 15 minutes until the apples begin to brown and have softened. Add the ham and sprinkle with the lemon juice nutmeg and salt. Cover and set aside until ready to fill the cr&#234;pes.  Heat a 9- to 11-inch crepe pan over medium-low heat until hot enough for a drop of water to sizzle on contact. Brush the surface of the crepe pan with a thin film of the melted butter. Blot any excess with the tip of a paper towel. Stir the cr&#234;pe batter well with the whisk. ladle about  1/3 cup of the batter into the heated pan and simultaneously tilt and roll the pan from side to side to coat the surface with a thin layer of batter. Cook for 1 minute or until the edges begin to set. run the tip of a small narrow rubber spatula under the edges of the cr&#234;pe to loosen it from the pan. Use your fingertips to lift the cr&#234;pe and quickly flip it over. Cook the other side for 30 seconds or until the batter is set into a thin pancake. Do not brown the cr&#234;pe or cook it until crisp. Transfer the cr&#234;pe to a large round plate. repeat with the remaining batter brushing the pan with more butter if necessary. Stack the cr&#234;pes as they are made. You should have 12 cr&#234;pes. if making ahead wrap the cr&#234;pes in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent drying out. The cr&#234;pes can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.  If the cr&#234;pes have been made ahead fill them one at a time by first warming each crepe in the pan over low heat. While they are still in the pan sprinkle about  3/4 cup of the cheese in the center of the cr&#234;pe. Top the cheese with a large spoonful of the warm apple filling spreading it into a single layer. Fold in two opposite sides of the circle to cover the filling. Then fold in the remaining two rounded sides overlapping slightly to form a square envelope. With a wide spatula lift the cr&#234;pe from the pan and invert it so it is seam side down onto a serving plate. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm if not serving at once. Fill the remaining cr&#234;pes in the same way. reserve the remaining filling.  Just before serving brush the smooth top of each cr&#234;pe with a thin film of the softened butter. reheat the remaining apple filling and spoon a portion on top of each cr&#234;pe. Serve at once.   
Pasta with Baby Artichokes Mascarpone and Hazelnuts from Bon Appetit,by Bon Appetit,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Pasta with Baby Artichokes Mascarpone and Hazelnuts from Bon Appetit,ings, The only thing that makes in-season vegetables even better? Fresh pasta. The hardest part of making this recipe is trimming the artichokes which isn’t as hard as it seems. If you can’t get your hands on baby artichokes use the hearts of two globe artichokes.   12 oz. fresh lasagna sheets (about 8- x 6-inch)  All-purpose flour (for surface)  1 lemon halved 1 lb. baby artichokes (about 8)  3 garlic cloves crushed 2 bay leaves  3/4 cup plus 3 Tbsp. olive oil Kosher salt  3/4 cup blanched hazelnuts 2 Tbsp. finely chopped marjoram or oregano 1 1/2 tsp. Aleppo-style pepper 1 cup mascarpone 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice   , Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Using a paring knife or a pastry wheel cut the sheet into quarters (each piece should be about 4- x 3-inch) then cut each piece on a diagonal from corner to corner to create 4 triangles. Transfer triangles to a flour-dusted baking sheet and cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat process with remaining lasagna sheets.   Squeeze juice from lemon halves into a large bowl of cold water. Working with 1 artichoke at a time pull off all the tough dark outer leaves until mostly yellow leaves remain. Using a serrated knife cut 1-inch off top of artichoke. Trim stem leaving at least  1/2-inch intact. Using a paring knife or a vegetable peeler remove dark green outer layer from stem. Cut artichoke in half lengthwise and then into  1/3-inch thick wedges. Drop artichoke pieces in lemon water. The acid in the water will keep them from turning brown while you trim the remaining artichokes.  Once all the artichokes have been trimmed drain and place in a wide medium saucepan. Add garlic bay leaves and  3/4 cup oil. Pour in cold water to submerge artichokes; season generously with salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until a paring knife slides through artichokes with little to no resistance 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool then drain and set artichokes aside.  While the artichokes are simmering away toast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet tossing once until golden brown 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool then coarsely chop. Toss in a medium bowl with marjoram Aleppo-style pepper and 3 Tbsp. oil; season with a generous pinch of salt. Set aside.  Mix mascarpone lemon zest and lemon juice in a separate medium bowl; season with salt. Set aside.  Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water stirring occasionally until very al dente. Drain reserving  1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid.  Return pasta and  3/4 cup pasta cooking liquid to pot and set over low heat. Add reserved mascarpone mixture and gently toss adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed if sauce is too thick until pasta is al dente and sauce coats pasta. Add reserved artichokes and half of reserved hazelnut mixture and gently stir to distribute (you want to avoid breaking up artichokes very much).  Divide pasta among bowls. Top with remaining hazelnut mixture.  Do Ahead: Hazelnuts can be toasted 3 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature. Artichokes can be trimmed and cooked 1 day ahead; let cool in cooking liquid. Cover and chill. Drain just before adding to pasta.   
Autumn Leaf Apple-Cranberry Pie,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Autumn Leaf Apple-Cranberry Pie,1 (9- or 10-inch) pie,  2 recipes Flaky Pie Dough (recipe attached)  3 3/4 pounds (about 8 medium) crisp-tart apples such as Granny Smith Gala Honeycrisp or Fuji peeled cored and cut into  3/4-inch thick slices 10 ounces fresh cranberries (about 2 1/2 cups) roughly chopped in a food processor    1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar  3/4 cup granulated sugar plus more for dusting crust      1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg  1/8 teaspoon ground allspice  1/8 teaspoon ground cloves   1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt  2 tablespoons cornstarch  1 large egg  1 tablespoon milk  Good-quality vanilla ice cream for serving   , When choosing baking apples look for firm sturdy apples that will hold their shape in the oven. Otherwise you'll end up with applesauce pie.  Tart Granny Smiths are reliable and available in every market in the country but try seeking out local varieties at the farmers' market or roadside stands during apple season. Don't be afraid to mix and match apples. A few tart and sturdy ones with a few sweet can be a great combination.   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and place a baking sheet on the rack.   To prepare filling: In a large bowl gently toss apples and chopped cranberries with brown sugar granulated sugar lemon juice spices salt and cornstarch until evenly coated. Transfer mixture to a large skillet or Dutch oven. Cook apples over medium-high heat until juices are very thick and apples are crisp-tender about 7 minutes. Remove filling from heat set aside to cool completely. (This filling can be made up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated.)   To prepare pie shell: Lightly flour a work surface. Place one recipe of pastry dough and dust a little flour on top. Roll out the dough into a 14-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Trim the dough so that it overhangs by 1-inch. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.   Lightly flour work surface place the remaining pastry dough in the center and dust a little flour on top. Roll out the dough into a 14-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Use decorative pastry cutters or mini cookie cutters to make 3 or 4 cuts around the center of the dough to form the vents keep the pastry cutouts set aside.    Fill chilled pie shell with the cooled filling. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over the pie dish and carefully unroll the dough to cover the top. Trim the top crust flush with the rim and decoratively crimp the edges. (Chill pie while rolling out any remaining dough scraps to make additional decorative cutouts optional.)     In a small bowl beat the egg with the milk to create an egg wash and use a pastry brush to lightly glaze the surface of the pie. Arrange your decorative cutouts on the top of the pie crust and brush with egg wash. Lightly dust pie with granulated sugar. Bake pie for 60 minutes or until the crust is a lovely golden brown and the apples are bubbling. (Plan on an additional 20 minutes of baking time if the pie filling has been made ahead and refrigerated).  Halfway through baking cover crust with foil or pie crust shield. Transfer pie to a cooling rack and let cool for at least one hour. Serve warm or at room temperature with a scoop of ice cream.   Plan Your Baking Time:  Don't forget that pies have long bake times and often cook at different oven temperatures. Assemble and bake pies the night before or early morning on Thanksgiving Day before your oven is packed with the rest of your holiday dishes. This way the pies have ample time to bake and cool before things really start to heat up in the kitchen.     Getting Ahead: You can make the pie crust 2 days ahead and keep it chilled and covered. You can prepare and cook the apple-cranberry filling up to 3 days in advance.   Storing: The pie will keep at room temperature under a cake dome for up to 2 days. For longer storage cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Reheat in a 375 degrees F oven for 15 to 20 minutes to warm the filling and re-crisp the crust.    
Classic Apple Pie,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Classic Apple Pie,1 (9-inch) pie,  2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 10 tablespoons (1 3/4 sticks) cold unsalted butter cut into tablespoons 6 ounces cream cheese (not low-fat) at room temperature cut into  3/4-inch pieces  4 pounds Golden Delicious apples 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter divided  1/2 cup sugar divided plus 1 teaspoon  3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon heavy cream or whole milk   ,  The attractive high dome of an apple pie can be considered a ruse as the apples have shrunk leaving a big space between the filling and the crust. Precooking the apples will minimize the gap and concentrate the apple flavor too.  To make the dough put the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse briefly to combine them. Scatter the butter and cream cheese over the top and pulse about 12 times or just enough until the dough begins to clump together (butter pieces will still be visible). Turn the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and gather it together.  Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled but not hard 1 to 2 hours.  To make the filling: peel and quarter the apples and cut out the core from each quarter. Cut each quarter lengthwise into thirds and place in a large bowl. As you add the slices to the bowl occasionally sprinkle and toss the apples with lemon juice. (Don't wait until the apples are cut or the first slices will already have turned brown.)  In a large skillet melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add half the apples and  3/4 cup of the sugar. Cook stirring often for about 7 minutes or until the apples are barely tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Transfer to a large bowl or rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter the second half of the apples and another  3/4 cup sugar. If your skillet is smaller than 12 inches cook the apples in three batches. Let the filling cool completely stirring occasionally. Sprinkle the flour and cinnamon over the cooled filling and toss well.  Position a rack in the center of the oven and place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.   Lightly flour a work surface and draw a 12-inch circle in the flour. This guide will be the perfect size for a standard 9-inch pie dish. Place 1 dough disk in the center of the circle and dust a little flour on top. Using the circle as a guide roll out the dough into a 12-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over a 9-inch pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Fill with the apples.   Trim the overhanging dough to  1/2 inch. Roll out the remaining pie dough into a second 12-inch round. Transfer the dough round the same way centering it over the apple filling. Fold the overhang of the upper round under the edge of the bottom crust. Pinch the crusts together and flute the edge attractively. Cut a small hole in the center of the pie to allow steam to escape. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.  To bake and serve: lightly brush the top crust with the cream. Sprinkle the top crust with the remaining teaspoon of sugar. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake for 40 to 50 minutes until the top is golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour. Serve warm or at room temperature.  
Apple-Cranberry Pocket Pies,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Apple-Cranberry Pocket Pies,8 pocket pies, Apple-Cranberry Filling:   1 cup granulated sugar  1/2 cup orange juice 1 cup fresh or frozen whole cranberries 2 tart apples diced 1 tablespoon onion chopped  1/2 cup golden raisins  1/2 cup light brown sugar  3/4 cup apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon salt  3/4 teaspoon allspice  3/4 teaspoon ground ginger  3/4 teaspoon cloves  1/2 cup walnuts chopped   Egg wash:   2 large eggs 3 tablespoons water Demerra sugar for garnish  Flaky Pie Dough:   1- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes  1/2 to  1/3 cup ice water   , You may remember the sugar-coated fruit and pudding pies sold in grocery stores during your childhood. Now pocket pies are all the rage again. These mini-pies featuring a delicious apple-cranberry filling are perfect for after-school treats or as a nostalgic addition to a dessert buffet. Any remaining filling can be frozen for future use.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees and place rack in the upper and lower thirds.   To prepare the apple-cranberry filling: Place all ingredients except raisins and walnuts into blender and pulse for 1 minute or until desired chunkiness is obtained. Place mixture in a bowl and stir in raisins and chopped walnuts.   To assemble pocket pies: Remove pie dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before rolling. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll chilled dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until dough is 1/8 inch thick. Using a 6-inch round cookie cutter cut 8 circles of dough rerolling once as needed. In a small mixing bowl whisk together egg and water for egg wash.  Place approximately 2 Tbsp. of the mixture in the center of each dough circle leaving a  1/2" border (avoid overstuffing dough as filling will leak out). Using a fingertip or small brush coat the dough edge halfway around with egg wash. Fold uncoated dough edge over to create a half-circle shape and press to seal and remove any air bubbles. Place assembled pocket pies on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray. Continue with remaining dough circles and freeze assembled pies for 30 minutes before baking. Save remaining egg wash.   Baking and serving: Remove pocket pies from freezer and cut a small "x " in the top of each with a sharp paring knife. Brush tops of pies with egg wash to coat. Sprinkle each with Demerra sugar and place pans in preheated oven. Bake until pocket pies are golden brown about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove pans from oven and allow pies to cool for 5 minutes. Using a large spatula transfer pies to a cooling rack.    Pocket pies can be served warm or room temperature.    Flaky Pie Dough:  Yield: 1 9- to 10-inch crust   To make the dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring.  Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times.

Flaky Pie Dough,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Flaky Pie Dough,1 (9-inch) pie crust,  1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes  3/4 to  1/3 cup ice water   ,  This recipe can be used to make both sweet and savory pies and tarts. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month. You can also save more time by making the dough in the food processor. Place the flour and cold butter in the processor bowl and pulse to cut the butter into the flour then transfer to a large mixing bowl and proceed with the recipe. Make sure to weigh your ingredients for best results.  To make the dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring.  Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.   
White Chocolate Gelato with Pistachio Cream Swirl,Southern Italian Desserts,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/White Chocolate Gelato with Pistachio Cream Swirl,about 1 1/2 quarts,  1 cup (240 ml) whole milk 4 large egg yolks  1/2 cup (100 g) sugar 6 ounces (170 g) white chocolate coarsely chopped 1 1/2 cups (240 ml) heavy cream 1 (6.3-ounces/ 180-g) jar crema di pistachio    ,  The town of Bronte at the foot of Mount Etna is prized for its flavorful bright green pistachios originally brought to Sicily by tenth-century Arab conquerors. The nuts are showcased in that town and throughout the island in all manner of desserts. This gelato recipe is from my sister-in-law Giuseppina who lives in Palermo and makes her own gelato at home. She adds flair and flavor to a white chocolate ice cream by swirling in a paste made from the sweetened pistachios. The recipe calls for crema di pistachio a sweetened pistachio cream found in some upscale food stores or ordered online. For the best quality make sure the paste comes from Bronte. If you can't find the pistachio cream try swirling chocolate- hazelnut paste or other flavorings into the white chocolate gelato. Choose a good-quality white chocolate such as Valrhona or Guittard.  Bring the milk to a simmer in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. While it is heating whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl until thick and creamy. Slowly pour half of the hot milk into the egg mixture whisking constantly as you pour.  Pour the milk and egg mixture back into the saucepan again whisking constantly. Continue to cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat add the white chocolate and let it stand for about 2 minutes to allow the chocolate to melt. Stir until completely smooth. Stir in the cream.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl set over a larger bowl filled with ice and water and let cool stirring occasionally and taking care not to slosh water into the mixture until cold.  Process the mixture in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's directions. When it is ready transfer the ice cream to a bowl and gently stir in the crema di pistachio to create swirls. Pack the ice cream into an airtight container and freeze until firm at least 3 hours or up to 1 week before serving.

Arroz con Pollo with Chorizo and Capers,Knives Cooks Love:Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Sarah Jay photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/Arroz con Pollo with Chorizo and Capers,6 servings,  8 ounces Mexican chorizo or sweet Italian sausage 1 (3- to 3 1/2-pound) chicken cut into 8 serving pieces (see page 154) wings and back reserved for stock 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin  3/4 teaspoon paprika  3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric &#185;&#8260;8 teaspoon chili powder 1 onion cut into  3/4-inch dice (see page 96) 1 red bell pepper cut into  1/2- inch dice (see page 116) 5 large cloves garlic chopped coarsely (see page 100)  3/4 cup dry white wine  3/4 cup crushed canned tomatoes 1 bay leaf 2 3/4 cups medium-grain rice 2 1/2 cups chicken broth 3 tablespoons capers in brine drained but not rinsed Lemon wedges and hot sauce for serving (optional)   , When using a cut-up whole chicken (rather than only legs and thighs) for this dish you need to take precautions to keep the breast meat from drying out. The trick is to sear the breast pieces briefly and then add them to the rice halfway through cooking. Mexican chorizo a fresh sausage seasoned with garlic and paprika delivers more authentic flavor. Look for it in Hispanic groceries.  Cut the chorizo in half lengthwise then crosswise into 1-inch chunks (it's easier if the casing side is up; the casing shouldn't come off but if it does just discard it). Set aside.  Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Season with 2 teaspoons of the kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper. Heat the oil in a medium (5-quart) Dutch oven or heavy casserole over medium-high heat. Sear the drumsticks and thighs until deeply golden on all sides 7 to 10 minutes (use a splatter screen if you have one). Transfer the pieces to a large bowl. Sear the breast pieces on the skin side only until golden about 3 minutes. Transfer them to the bowl. Lower the heat to medium and sear the chorizo stirring frequently until golden brown 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to the bowl.  Pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon of oil. Spoon out any burnt bits. Combine the cumin paprika turmeric and chili powder in a small dish. Set the pot over medium heat and add the onion and bell pepper. Cook for 2 minutes stirring often; the moisture in the vegetables will deglaze the browned drippings in the pan. Add the garlic and cook stirring until the vegetables are softened about 3 minutes. Add the measured spices and cook stirring for 1 minute to let the flavors bloom.  Add the wine tomatoes the remaining  1/2 teaspoon salt and the bay leaf. Increase the heat to medium-high and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the drumsticks thighs and chorizo to the pot. Add the rice and broth. Bring to a boil cover lower the heat to medium-low and simmer for 9 minutes.  Add the breast pieces to the pot nestling them into the rice and continue simmering until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed about 9 minutes more.  Remove the pan from the heat and let rest covered for 5 minutes. Sprinkle the capers on top of the rice. When spooning out portions look for the bay leaf and discard it. Serve with the lemon wedges and hot sauce.

Blood Orange Chicken with Whiskey and Green Olives,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Blood Orange Chicken with Whiskey and Green Olives,4 servings,  2 small blood oranges or 1 large Cara Cara or navel orange  3/4 cup smoky Scotch whiskey or Pernod 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard Juice of 1 lemon 2 teaspoons fennel seeds lightly crushed 3 sprigs fresh thyme 1 garlic clove grated on a Microplane or minced 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Pinch of red chile flakes 1 small red onion 1 small fennel bulb trimmed fronds chopped for garnish 1 whole chicken (3 1/2 pounds) cut into 8 pieces and patted dry Extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling  1/2 cup pitted green olives quartered lengthwise  1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar   ,  A little more involved than the other sheet-pan suppers in this book there are several steps necessary to create this lively pretty Mediterranean-flavored dish-including caramelizing pans of sliced blood oranges marinated chicken and roasted fennel and onion under the broiler in quick succession. It's not at all hard and the layering of flavors-briny olives smoky garlicky meat and juicy-sweet citrus-is worth the extra attention.  Finely grate the zest of one blood orange (or half of a large orange) and place in a large bowl.  Slice the ends off the oranges. Stand each orange up on a cut end and use a paring knife to slice off the peel and pith. Slice oranges crosswise into  3/4-inch-thick rounds and set aside.  Stir the whiskey brown sugar mustard lemon juice fennel seeds thyme sprigs garlic salt pepper and chile flakes into the bowl containing the orange zest.  Cut the onion in half lengthwise through the root. Cut each half into  3/4-inch-thick wedges keeping the root end intact. Do the same with the fennel bulb. Add the onion fennel and chicken pieces to the bowl. Toss the entire mixture well to combine. Let it stand covered at room temperature for 30 minutes or refrigerate it overnight.  Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 475 degrees  F.  Remove the chicken and vegetables from the marinade leaving as much liquid behind as possible (discard the liquid). Arrange the meat and vegetables in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast until the chicken is just cooked through about 30 minutes.  Turn the oven to broil and broil the chicken until it is blistery 1 to 2 minutes (watch it carefully). Transfer the chicken to a platter and tent it with aluminum foil to rest. Sprinkle the olives over the vegetables. If the vegetables look pale run the sheet quickly under the broiler until the vegetables brown and caramelize; watch them carefully so they don't burn. (If they don't need broiling just toss the vegetables and olives together in the baking sheet to warm up the olives.)  Arrange the reserved orange slices in a small roasting pan sprinkle the slices with sugar and broil until browned in spots 5 to 10 minutes. Scrape the vegetable mixture and the pan juices over the chicken and serve topped with the oranges and fennel fronds.  Reprinted from Dinner: Changing the Game copyright &#169; 2017 by Melissa Clark.

To prepare frosting: To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment add butter cream cheese and vanilla; beat on medium speed until very smooth 1 to 2 minutes.  Reduce speed to low add the sugar 1 cup at a time and mix until just incorporated. Increase speed to medium and beat until frosting is fluffy 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the frosting to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip filling it halfway for the ease of piping. To decorate cupcakes: Holding disposable pastry bag with frosting just above the cupcake squeeze bag to release frosting and form a star. When you reach the size of the star you wish to form stop the pressure on the bag and pull it up and away to stop more frosting from coming out and form a perfect star top. Continue piping until the top of the cupcake is covered with desired amount of frosting.

To the flat side place about 2 tablespoons of frosting and using an offset spatula spread into an even layer. Repeat with the remaining flat-side up cakes.  Transfer remaining frosting into a piping bag fitted with a medium-small open round tip. Pipe and decorate the dome-side up cakes as desired.  Place the decorated cake on top of its matched frosted bottom and press gently to adhere the sides together. Serve immediately or place in an airtight food storage container and refrigerate for up to 1 week.  Decorating ideas: Pipe sweet words such as; Sweet Sweetheart and Love onto top cake. Pipe people’s names on to top cake. Pipe hearts dots or flowers onto top cake. Dust a plain top with confectioners’ sugar. 
SPINACH TAGLIATELLE,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/SPINACH TAGLIATELLE,rvings,  3 ounces spinach washed and trimmed 1/2 teaspoon fine kosher salt plus more for salting water 1 large egg 1 large egg yolk 1 1/4 cups (6 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour plus more for dusting Semolina flour for dusting pasta and surfaces    , Tagliatelle pappardelle tagliolini are just a few of our favorite hand-cut ribbon pasta. The only difference between the shapes is the width in which it is cut. Tagliatelle meaning “cut” in Italian is cut to 1/3-inch pappardelle to 3/4-inch and tagliolini to 1/8-inch. The general rule of thumb for the sauce is the wider the ribbon the heavier the sauce.   1. To blanch spinach:   Fill a large pot of water and bring to a rolling boil. Generously salt water. Add spinach to boiling water and cook until tender about 30 seconds. Using tongs transfer spinach to a colander and rinse under cold water. Thoroughly spin dry spinach in a salad spinner or wring dry in a clean kitchen towel.  2. To prepare dough: To the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade purée spinach. Add eggs and yolk to purée and process until well combined. Add flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and process until dough comes together about 20 seconds.  3. Transfer dough to well-floured surface. Knead dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky adding small amounts of flour as needed 6 to 8 minutes. Gather dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover in plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour at room temperature.  4. To roll out and cut dough:  Secure a pasta machine to edge of a long countertop. Using a bench scraper cut dough into 2 pieces. Keep extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with one piece. With a rolling pin or your hand roll or flatten dough into a rough rectangle that will fit inside widest setting of pasta machine. Roll dough through machine catching it with one hand as you roll with other. Take dough and trifold it like a letter. Turn dough so one open end faces machine and roll it through on widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting.   5. Continue rolling pasta through machine without folding adjusting rollers to a smaller setting each time. Roll out each sheet to second to last thinnest setting. If pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.   6. To shape the tagliatelle:  Liberally flour one sheet of pasta and loosely roll it into a cylinder. Using a sharp knife cut roll into 1/3" ribbons. Unwrap ribbons toss them with semolina flour and form into piles on baking sheets dusted with semolina. The pasta can be cooked immediately or covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use.   7. To cook the pasta: To a large pot of water set over high heat add water to 2/3 full and bring to a boil. Generously season water with salt. Add pasta and stir immediately to prevent tagliatelle from sticking together. Boil until al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain pasta through a colander. Use reserved pasta water to thin your chosen pasta sauce. 
Whole Wheat Waffles with Strawberry Sauce,Braun,home/recipes/breakfast/pancakes-french-toast-waffles/Whole Wheat Waffles with Strawberry Sauce,4 to 6 servings (about 7 to 8 waffles + 2 cups of sauce),   Strawberry sauce:    3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice  1 tablespoon cornstarch  1 pound frozen whole strawberries  2 tablespoons real maple syrup    Waffles:   3/4 cups all-purpose flour    3/4 cup whole wheat flour  1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder  1 teaspoon baking soda   1/2 teaspoon salt   1/3 cup sugar   1 teaspoon cinnamon  3 large eggs separated   3/4 cup unsalted butter melted and slightly cooled  1 3/4 cups low fat buttermilk    , This recipe was prepared using Braun's Multiquick 7 Hand blender with the blending shaft whisk and beaker attachments.     Prep: 20 minutes  Cook: about 50-60 minutes (this really depends on the type of waffle machine people have and also includes the time it takes to make the sauce.)  Difficulty level: Medium    To prepare sauce whisk together in a small bowl orange juice and cornstarch using the Braun Multiquick 7 hand blender with its whisk attachment. Add strawberries to a medium-sized pot. Turn heat on medium and cook strawberries for about 5 minutes or until strawberries are softened and there is juice in the pot. Add cornstarch and orange juice mixture and syrup and bring to a boil. Let simmer for 2-4 minutes until sauce has thickened. Remove from heat.     Using the Braun Multiquick 7 Hand blender with the blending shaft attachment blend strawberries into sauce on high speed for about 30 seconds. Set aside until ready to serve with waffles.    To make waffles preheat waffle maker on medium-high heat. Preheat oven to 200 degrees  F. Place a wire rack on a baking sheet; set aside.    In a large bowl combine flour baking powder baking soda salt sugar and cinnamon. Set aside.     In another large bowl using the Braun Multiquick 7 Hand blender with the whisk attachment whisk the egg yolks butter and buttermilk together until combined on low speed. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk gently until smooth but do not over mix. Wash the whisk attachment.    In beaker attachment of the Multiquick 7 Hand blender add the egg whites and whisk on the highest speed until stiff peaks form. Using a rubber spatula gently fold the egg whites into the batter.   Pour about  1/2 cup of the batter depending on the size of your waffle maker into each well of the waffle maker and close the lid. Cook the waffles until golden brown and crisp about 3 to 6 minutes-but depends on your waffle maker. Transfer the cooked waffles to the wire rack and keep warm in the preheated oven as you cook the rest. Repeat to cook the remaining batter.   Serve the waffles immediately with strawberry sauce. Or extras can be refrigerated or frozen and then warmed in the toaster.   
Focaccia Ligure,Academia Barilla adapted by the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Focaccia Ligure,10 servings,  17 1/2 oz (500g) water warm (105 degrees F to 115 degrees F) 1 oz (30g) quick rise yeast 1 tablespoon (15g) barley malt or sugar 2 pounds (900g) Caputo 00 Pizza Flour  1/3 cup (100g) boiled mashed potatoes 1 tablespoon (25g) salt 3 1/2 oz (100g) Extra Virgin Olive Oil Riviera Ligure DOP Academia Barilla  For the preparation of the solution:  1/2 cup water 1 tablespoon salt  1/3  cup (for 21 oz. of dough) Extra Virgin Olive Oil Riviera Ligure DOP Academia Barilla 4 teaspoons Sapori Italiani Academia Barilla to taste   , Focaccia is a popular Italian yeast bread which is sometimes compared to pizza as they are both are flat breads. The focus of focaccia however is on the bread rather than the toppings although toppings for focaccia are almost as diverse as those on pizza.   The top of the focaccia is dimpled and brushed with oil to keep the bread moist and flavorful. The dimpling in the dough is usually accomplished by poking it gently with the fingers just before dressing the bread. The dimples collect oil and any added herbs and spices-creating pockets of flavor. A well-made focaccia should feel light and flavorful not greasy and heavy.  In Italy flour is classified either as 1 0 or 00 and refers to how finely ground the flour is and how much of the bran and germ have been removed. Doppio zero is the most highly refined and is talcum-powder soft. It's made from spring wheat in the Campania region of Italy '00' flours work beautifully for breads pasta and pizza.   Place pizza stone the oven and preheat oven to 475 degrees F. The stone needs to heat in the oven for  1/2 hour to 1 hour before baking focaccia.  Place the warm water in large bowl. Sprinkle in dry yeast and barley malt or sugar; stir with fork. Let stand until yeast dissolves about 10 minutes.  Add flour mashed potatoes and salt to yeast mixture and stir to blend well (dough will be sticky). Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic adding more flour by tablespoon increments if dough is too sticky about 10 minutes. Form dough into ball. Oil large bowl; add dough turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm area until doubled about 1 hour. Punch down dough; divide the dough into pieces of about 21 oz. each then shape each piece into round or cylindrical shapes about  1/2 inch thick.  Using your fingers put divots in the dough and brush the dough with the water salt and olive oil mixture (the 'solution'). Sprinkle dough with Sapori seasoning. Using a pizza peel slide the dough onto the pre-heated pizza stone. Cook for about 18-20 minutes and serve.   
Fresh Fruit Quesadillas,Things Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Marie Simmons photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/appetizers/vegetarian/Fresh Fruit Quesadillas,4 servings,  4 (9-inch) corn or flour tortillas 1 1/2 teaspoons flavorless vegetable oil 2 cups (4 ounces) shredded queso asadero or Monterey Jack cheese 2 large or 3 medium peaches (peeled) or nectarines (unpeeled) halved pitted and very thinly sliced (about 2 cups) 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro 1 jalepe&ntilde;o chile seeded and thinly sliced into rounds   , This recipe departs from the traditional with thin peach slices added to the cheese chiles and cilantro. Instead of a skillet use the pepper roaster to toast the filled quesadillas and melt the cheese.  Lay the tortillas on a cutting board. Lightly brush the tops with oil. Turn the tortillas oiled side down.  Divide the cheese evenly among the tortillas. Make a visual line down the center of each tortilla. Arrange a layer of the peach slices to the right of the visual line so the fruit covers half of the opened tortilla. Sprinkle the peaches with the cilantro and chile dividing them evenly. Fold the tortillas in half over the filling.  Preheat a stove-top pepper roaster griddle or skillet over medium-high heat until hot enough for a drop of water to sizzle on contact. Add as many folded tortillas as will fit without crowding. Adjust the heat to medium-low and grill for 2 to 3 minutes until the underside is lightly browned. Use a wide spatula to turn the tortillas over and grill for 1 to 2 minutes more until lightly browned on the second side and the cheese is melted. Using the spatula return the quesadillas to the cutting board. Repeat with the remaining folded tortillas.  To serve: cut each half circle into 3 wedges and arrange on a platter or a tray. Serve hot.

Greek Yogurt,Fagor,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Greek Yogurt,1 serving, You only need two ingredients to make yogurt at home: any type of milk and plain store-bought yogurt (with live active cultures) or starter yogurt.    Choosing the Milk - The following types of milk may be used:  Pasteurized milk of any fat content (full 2% 1% or skim milk)  Powdered milk  Long-life UHT sterilized milk  Soy Milk (Be sure to use UHT soy milk which contains one of the following ingredients: fructose honey or malt. These ingredients are necessary for fermentation and you will not succeed if none are available in the milk.)  Live Active Cultures-Unflavored Yogurt (All you need is a small amount of plain unflavored yogurt with live active cultures often called probiotics. The plain yogurt can either be purchased from a store or used from a previous batch of homemade yogurt.)  NOTE: For 5 cups of milk use  1/2 cup of plain yogurt or 1 packet starter culture. For 1 cup of milk use about one tablespoon of plain yogurt.    , Yogurt Making Process:  Take the starter yogurt from the refrigerator so that it has time to come to room temperature while you heat the milk.   Place the desired amount of milk in the removable cooking pot. Leave the lid off and heat the milk to 180-185 degrees F by pressing the SLOW COOK LOW function. Use a thermometer to make sure that proper temperature has been reached.   Remove the removable cooking pot from heat and allow the milk to cool to lukewarm (100 degrees F-110 degrees F). To accelerate the cooling down process place the removable cooking pot in cold water. Do not let it cool below 90 degrees F.   Stir in the plain yogurt or starter culture packet and use a silicone whisk (metal will scratch cooking pot) to mix it with the milk until the consistency is smooth with no lumps remaining.  Place the lid on the Multi-cooker; align the handle with the condensation collector (open lock symbol) and turn it counterclockwise until the locking pin clicks into place. Turn the pressure regulator knob to STEAM when using the yogurt program. Press the YOGURT button. The preset cooking time is 8 hours. Depending on the flavor of yogurt you like best you can choose how long to cook the yogurt for by pressing the + or - button. With longer cooking time the yogurt will have a more tart flavor. With shorter time the yogurt will have a milder flavor.   Press the START/STOP button to begin the yogurt function. The unit will begin to count down in 1 minute increments once the correct temperature has been reached.   When the yogurt is ready remove the lid. There may be some yellowish liquid whey on top of the yogurt. This is normal whey contains nutrients and protein. Mix it back into the yogurt.   If you prefer regular yogurt cover and place in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours before serving or until yogurt cools down. If you prefer Greek yogurt continue reading.    Greek Yogurt: Place the strainer or a cheese cloth inside a container so the strainer doesn't touch the bottom of the container to allow for better drainage.   Pour the homemade yogurt into the strainer or cheese cloth and cover with the lid. Put it in the refrigerator to strain and chill for at least 2 hours. The longer the time the thicker the yogurt becomes.   Gently remove yogurt from strainer or cheese cloth by turning the strainer or cheese cloth upside down on a plate or container.   Put it back in the refrigerator to chill for another few hours before serving.

Bolognese,Recipe developed for Fagor by America's TEST KITCHEN,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Bolognese,4 cups,   1 onion chopped coarse  1 large carrot peeled and chopped coarse 1 celery rib chopped coarse  4 ounces pancetta chopped  4 ounces mortadella chopped   3 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound meatloaf mix   3 tablespoons minced fresh sage 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste  1 cup dry red wine  2 cups beef broth   Salt and pepper   , Bolognese is typically a labor of love involving a lot of prep and hours spent at the stove. The pressure-cooker cuts down on time yet adds concentrated rich flavor resulting in a sauce that tastes like it's been cooking all day.    Total time: About 1- 1/2 hours 30 minutes under pressure Pressure level: High Release: Quick   Bolognese is typically a labor of love involving a long shipping list a lot of prep and hours spent at the stove. For this version we started with meatloaf mix which was an easy way to add lots of meaty flavor from beef pork and veal sold in one simple package. A few ounces each of mortadella and pancetta gave our sauce a richness to take it to the next level. To quickly break down our classic Italian aromatic soffritto base of onion celery and carrot as well as the mortadella and pancetta we turned to our food processor.   We added the meatloaf mix to the pot first to cook off moisture. Once it began to sizzle we knew it was time to saute the soffritto and other meats in the rendered fat building another layer of deep flavor. Then our pressure cooker came into play. We added our wine and broth to the pot locked on the lid and cooked our sauce for just 30 minutes. The end result was a sauce with concentrated rich flavor that tasted like it had been cooked all day. Garnish with Parmesan if desired.  Prep ingredients:  Pulse onion carrot and celery in food processor until finely chopped about 10 pulses; transfer to bowl. Pulse pancetta and mortadella in now-empty food processor until finely chopped about 25 pulses; transfer to separate bowl.  Build flavor:  Heat oil in pressure-cooker pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add meatloaf mix and cook breaking up pieces with spoon until all liquid has evaporated and meat begins to sizzle about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in processed pancetta mixture and sage; reduce heat to medium and cook stirring often until pancetta is translucent (about 5 to 7 minutes). Stir in processed vegetables and tomato paste and cook stirring often until mixture is rust-colored and fragrant about 3 minutes. Stir in wine scraping up any browned bits and cook until slightly thickened about 3 minutes. Stir in beef broth.  High pressure for 30 minutes:  Lock pressure-cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat. As soon as pot reaches high pressure reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 30 minutes adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure.   Quick release pressure:  Remove pot from heat. Quick release pressure then carefully remove lid allowing steam to escape away from you.  Before serving: Bring sauce to simmer over medium-high heat and cook until thickened about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon over cooked pasta and serve.  Troubleshooting:   What if I can't find meatloaf mix? You can substitute  1/2 pound each 85 percent lean ground beef and ground pork.  Recommended wine?: Use a good-quality medium-bodied wine such as C&#244;tes du Rh&#244;ne or Pinot Noir.  Do I need to alter the recipe for a 6-quart electric pressure cooker? Yes quick release the pressure immediately after the pressurized cooking time; do not let the cooker switch to the warm setting. Increase the simmering time to 20 minutes and use the browning (not the simmer) setting.

Carrot-Zucchini Bread with Candied Ginger,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Carrot-Zucchini Bread with Candied Ginger,2 (8-inch) loaves,  Nonstick cooking spray for preparing the pan 3 cups sifted unbleached all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon baking soda  3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt  1/2 cup minced candied ginger 3 large eggs 1 cup canola oil 1 3/4 cups sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup carrots peeled and grated on the large holes of a box grater 1 cup zucchini grated on the large holes of a box grater   , When summer delivers too many zucchini many people reach for a zucchini bread recipe. Here's one with a difference: wisps of grated carrot for color and nuggets of moist candied ginger for spice. The idea for jazzing up a quick bread this way comes from Annie Baker a respected pastry chef in California's Napa Valley. Wrap and freeze the second loaf if you don't plan to eat it within a day or two.  Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F. Coat two 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 3/4-inch loaf pans with nonstick cooking spray.  Sift together the sifted flour ginger cinnamon baking soda and baking powder into a medium bowl. Stir in the salt and candied ginger.  In a large bowl whisk the eggs until light and foamy. Add the canola oil sugar and vanilla whisking vigorously until the sugar dissolves. Whisk in the carrots and zucchini.  Add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture all at once and stir with a wooden spoon just until blended. Divide the batter evenly between the 2 prepared pans.  Bake until the breads are well risen and firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean about 1 hour. Let cool in the pans on a rack for 10 minutes then invert and finish cooling right side up on the rack.   
Oyster au Gratin with Champagne,GreenPan,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Oyster au Gratin with Champagne,4 servings,  2 egg yolks   1/2 cup (1.5 dl) cream  1/2 shallot   1/2 cup (1 dl) Champagne   1/2 cup (1 dl) oyster juice  24 large flat oysters  Juice from half a lemon    , Open the oysters catching the juice as you go in a measuring cup until you reach  1/2 cup. Place the oyster juice in a saucepan heating until it boils. Add the champagne and the shallot to the sauce and let it reduce to half. Let the sauce cool until it is lukewarm then add the egg yolks to the sauce and whisk the mixture well. Place aluminum foil on a baking sheet loosen the oysters from their shells and fixate the oysters on the foil to make sure they keep their position. Pour the sauce on the oysters and broil the oysters for 3 minutes. Take the oysters out of the oven and serve immediately.   
Grilled Scallops with Wilted Spinach and Lemon-Caper Butter,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Grilled Scallops with Wilted Spinach and Lemon-Caper Butter,4 servings,  Lemon-Caper Butter:  1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick) softened 2 tablespoons capers preferably salt packed rinsed and finely minced 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest 2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley Kosher or sea salt  1 pound sea scallops Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon unsalted butter melted 3 bunches (12 to 14 ounces each) spinach thick stems removed 4 lemon wedges   , In just a few moments on the stove a potful of rough fresh spinach leaves wilts down into a silky bed for grilled scallops. A composed butter enlivened with capers and lemon zest creates a simple sauce as it melts on the hot greens and shellfish. Be sure to warm the dinner plates for a few minutes in a low oven to keep the food hot. Both the spinach and the scallops cool off quickly otherwise.  Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium (375&deg;F). To make the lemon-caper butter put the butter capers lemon zest and parsley in a bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until smooth. Season to taste with salt.  Remove the "foot" or small muscle on the side of each scallop. Halve the scallops horizontally or slice them in thirds if they are jumbo scallops so the slices are no more than 1/2 inch thick. Season all over with salt and pepper and brush with the melted butter.  Put the spinach in a large pot with just the washing water clinging to the leaves. Cover and cook over moderate heat stirring with tongs once or twice until the spinach is barely wilted about 3 minutes. Drain in a sieve or colander. Do not press on the leaves or squeeze them to extract more liquid; you want to leave them fairly moist. Return them to the same pot and add half of the lemon-caper butter. Toss with tongs over low heat so that the butter melts and coats the spinach. Taste for salt. Keep the spinach warm while you grill the scallops.  Grill the scallops directly over the coals or gas flame turning once until they are nicely marked by the grill and no longer translucent about 5 minutes total.  Divide the spinach among warmed dinner plates. Arrange the scallops on top and immediately slather the scallops with the remaining butter. The butter will melt from the heat of the shellfish. Garnish each serving with a lemon wedge and serve immediately.

But too often they get short shrift: a quick drizzle of butter a squirt of lemon and onto the table they go. We suggest you coddle them a little this year. Try tossing them in a hot skillet with shallots and pecans that get caramelized in buttery brown sugar and you'll see just how special green beans can be. Try seasoning them with an alder-smoked salt for an extra layer of flavor.  Heat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle.  Bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add green beans and cook uncovered until just tender 3 to 4 minutes. Using a large slotted spoon or tongs transfer beans to colander in ice water to stop cooking then drain well and dry on towels. Set aside.  In a large skillet toast pecans over a medium-high heat shaking the pan occasionally until nuts are beginning to brown and smell toasty about 5 minutes. Transfer to a dish a reserve. Add butter to skillet and cook over medium heat until foam subsides. Stir in sugar until almost dissolved. Add pecans stirring to heat through about 1 minute. Set aside.  In a large skillet heat olive oil over medium heat until oil begins to shimmer. Add shallots and cook until tender about 3 minutes.  Add reserved green beans and lemon zest and saute tossing them with tongs until heated through about 2 to 4 minutes. Add the pecan mixture and toss to mix.

Look for Frenched racks which are lamb racks with the fat and membranes removed from the tops of the bones. If you want to prepare this dish for a crowd take a tip from restaurant chefs and quickly sear the chops on the grill to mark them. Once your guests arrive finish roasting the chops in a preheated 400 degrees F oven to make getting them to the table on time easier.  Using a sharp slicing knife cut the lamb racks into individual chops. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and season on all sides with salt and pepper.  In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade place garlic parsley and rosemary and process using pulses until roughly chopped. With machine running drizzle in olive oil to form a coarse paste. Remove the garlic and herb paste from the food processor and rub all over the lamb chops. Cover chops with plastic wrap and marinate at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes.  Prepare a hot charcoal fire preheat a gas grill to medium-high or heat a large grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat grill grates or grill pan with a thin coating of oil. Place the lamb chops on the grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs turn the chops and cook to medium rare 3 to 4 minutes longer. If chops are browning too quickly move them to a cooler spot on the grill.

To serve place chops on a serving platter and sprinkle with lemon juice. Garnish with additional parsley leaves and serve immediately.   
Goat Cheese Tortellini with Pancetta Sweet Peas and Mint,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Goat Cheese Tortellini with Pancetta Sweet Peas and Mint,4 servings,  Filling:   1/2 cup whole milk ricotta cheese strained (see instructions below)   3/4 cup fresh goat cheese 2 teaspoons lemon zest 2 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese grated 1 large egg lightly beaten  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt   3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  1 recipe Fresh Pasta Dough»  Semolina flour for dusting   Tortellini:   3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil more as needed 8 ounces pancetta finely diced  1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 large shallot minced  2 medium garlic cloves minced 1  1/2 cups shelled fresh peas or frozen if fresh is unavailable thawed  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  20 fresh mint leaves cut into ribbons  1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese grated plus more for serving   , Fresh tortellini seem complicated to make but by following a simple folding procedure and spending a little extra time you can have delicious fresh tortellini! If you want to stock up freeze tortellini in a single layer then transfer to sealable bags for long-term storage.      To make the filling:  Strain ricotta in a fine-mesh sieve over a medium bowl for at least 1 hour to remove excess liquid. Transfer ricotta to a medium bowl add goat cheese lemon zest Parmigiano-Reggiano egg salt and pepper; using a silicone spatula fold to combine and set aside.   To prepare the pasta:   Roll fresh pasta out into paper-thin sheets. Use a 3-inch pastry cutter to make rounds dust the tops of the pasta rounds with flour and cover loosely with a clean kitchen towel or a piece of plastic wrap. Repeat until all the pasta dough is used. (You can gather the pasta scraps and reroll them to make more rounds as long as they are still soft and workable.)   Fill and shape the tortellini:   Gather pasta rounds the filling a baking sheet coated with flour and a small bowl of water together next to a clean workspace. Line up 3 pasta rounds and place 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of each. Dip your finger in the bowl of water and run it along the edge of the round to moisten. Fold the dough over to form a half moon and press to seal. Next draw the two corners together to form a rounded bonnet shape and press the ends tightly together to seal. Place the tortellini on the floured baking sheet and repeat with remaining pasta rounds and filling.   To prepare the sauce:  To a large skillet over medium-high heat add olive oil. When oil is shimmering add pancetta and cook until crispy about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon transfer pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate. Reduce heat to medium and discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the skillet. Add butter shallot and garlic and cook until soft and translucent about 2 minutes. If using fresh peas add peas and  1/2 cup hot water. Stir well and simmer until peas are bright green and tender about 1 minute. (Omit water if using previously frozen peas.)  Remove pan from heat; taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside while preparing tortellini.   To cook the tortellini:   Heat a large pot of water over high heat until boiling. Generously season water with salt. Add tortellini and stir gently to prevent pasta from sticking together. Boil until the tortellini rise to the top of the water and filling is hot and cooked through 3 to 4 minutes.   Reserve about a cup of pasta water and use a fine-mesh sieve to transfer hot tortellini to skillet with sauce. Gently toss the pasta with the sauce adding the reserved pasta water as needed to thin the sauce. Add crispy pancetta and lemon juice and gently toss to combine. (Don't toss too much or pasta will break apart.)  To serve:   Taste and adjust seasoning with salt pepper and lemon juice. Divide tortellini among pasta bowls. Garnish with mint leaves grated cheese and freshly ground pepper; serve immediately. 
Chicken Tagine with Apricots and Almonds,Sur La Table & Renee Behnke Memorable Recipes,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Chicken Tagine with Apricots and Almonds,6 servings,  1&frasl;4 cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons ground ginger 11&frasl;2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs each cut into thirds 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 large yellow onion chopped 1 large red bell pepper cored seeded and chopped 6 cloves garlic pressed or minced 1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot 1 cup chicken stock or top-quality chicken broth 1&frasl;4 teaspoon saffron threads 5 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley 5 sprigs fresh cilantro 2  1/3 cups water 1 cup dried apricots each halved 1&frasl;4 cup honey 2 cinnamon sticks 2 cups couscous 3&frasl;4 cup toasted blanched whole almonds   , This tagine is an ideal example of Morocco's vibrant cuisine: chicken braised with warm spices dried apricots honey and vegetables in a stew of incomparable fragrance and flavor. I prefer to use chicken thigh meat; the darker meat stays moist and tender when simmered. You can use chicken breast pieces if you prefer but avoid overcooking.  Stir together the flour cinnamon ginger salt cumin turmeric and pepper in a large bowl. In batches add the chicken and toss well to evenly coat.  Heat the oil and butter in a deep saute pan over medium heat. Working in batches brown the chicken pieces for a few minutes on each side and transfer to a plate. Set aside.  Add the onion bell pepper garlic and shallot to the pan and cook for 3 to 5 minutes until just beginning to soften. Return the chicken to the pan with the chicken stock and saffron. Tie together the parsley and cilantro sprigs with kitchen string and add to the pan. Cover and cook over medium-low heat for about 30 minutes until the chicken is tender and cooked through. (The liquids should simmer gently not boil; decrease the heat if needed.)  While the chicken is cooking combine 1 cup of the water with the apricots honey and cinnamon sticks in a small saucepan. Bring just to a boil over medium-high heat. Decrease the heat to medium-low and simmer stirring occasionally for about 25 minutes or until the apricots are plump and the liquid is reduced to a thick glaze.  Add the apricot mixture to the chicken and continue simmering for 10 minutes. Check for seasoning adding more salt or pepper to taste. Discard the cinnamon sticks and herb bundle.  Place the couscous in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the remaining 11&frasl;3 cups water to a boil pour over the couscous and stir to mix. Cover the bowl with foil to seal securely and set aside for 5 minutes. Fluff the couscous with a fork and spoon it onto individual plates. Top the couscous with the chicken mixture. Scatter the almonds over and serve.

Add the food coloring if using and continue to whisk until stiff glossy peaks appear. Sift the almond flour powdered sugar and salt twice through a sieve. Add to the egg whites all at once and fold together. Continue to fold the batter until you can form a figure 8 with the batter without the batter breaking from the spatula.  Fill a piping bag fitted with a Wilton 2A or Ateco 805 tip. Pipe silver-dollar-sized rounds onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Bang the pan on the counter a few times to release any air bubbles. Let the cookies sit on the counter until the tops and sides of the cookies dry out. This could take 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on the moisture in the air. If the cookies aren't drying sit them next to a fan on low speed and rotate every 5 minutes. Place the macarons in the oven on the middle rack for 6 minutes then rotate and continue to bake for another 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately brush the tops with gold leaf. For the lemon buttercream beat the ingredients together until a creamy frosting appears about 2 minutes. Place into a piping bag fitted with a small star tip of your choice. Pipe the frosting on the bottom of one cookie and sandwich together with another.   Note   Cookies will keep up to 2 days covered on the counter. As with most meringue-based items macarons are best left to execute on less humid days. Take your time folding the batter. If you go too far and fold out too much of the air it's not possible to recover the batter. If this is your first-time trying macarons see video to visualize the best batter consistency.

Add the garlic and cook until fragrant about 1 minute. Add the apple cider used to marinate the pork broth and sage and cook until the sweet potatoes are tender and the sauce is reduced about 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside and keep warm.  To cook the pork medallions: Pat-dry the pork with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Place a large non-stick skillet on the stove over a medium-high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil.

Ultimate Pumpkin Pie with Rum Whipped Cream,Ina Garten Barefoot Contessa Foolproof,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Ultimate Pumpkin Pie with Rum Whipped Cream,8 to 10 servings,  Filling: 1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree (not pie filling)   1/2 cup light brown sugar lightly packed  3/4 cup granulated sugar  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon ground ginger  3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt 2 teaspoons grated orange zest 3 extra-large eggs lightly beaten 1 cup heavy cream  1/2 cup whole milk 2 tablespoons dark rum such as Mount Gay Dried beans for blind baking  Rum Whipped Cream: 1 cup cold heavy cream 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon mascarpone or creme fra&#238;che 1 tablespoon good dark rum such as Mount Gay 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  Perfect Pie Crust: yields 2 (9- to 11-inch crusts) 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) very cold unsalted butter 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon Kosher salt  1/3 cup very cold vegetable shortening such as Crisco  1/2 cup ice water   , Pumpkin pie can be boring and dense so I set out to make a better pumpkin pie. Pumpkin has a distinct squash flavor that you want to enhance without overpowering it. I’ve filled the prebaked crust with a lightly spiced pumpkin mixture that tastes more like a mousse than a dense custard. Dark rum and grated orange zest are my secret ingredients. - Ina Garten  Prepare the pie crust: Cut the butter in  1/2-inch dice and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. Place the flour sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out onto a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle at least 1 inch larger than the pie pan rolling from the center to the edge turning and flouring the dough so it doesn't stick to the board. (You should see bits of butter in the dough.) Fold the dough in half ease it into the pie pan without stretching at all and unfold to fit the pan. With a small sharp paring knife cut the dough 1 inch larger around than the pan. Fold the edge under and crimp the edge with either your fingers or the tines of a fork.  NOTE: Store the shortening in the refrigerator so it's always cold. You can store the prepared pie crust in the fridge for up to a day.  Make the pie: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Line an 11-inch pie pan with the unbaked pie crust and place it on a sheet pan. Line the crust with parchment paper. Fill the paper  3/4 full with the beans and bake the crust for 15 minutes until the edges start to brown. Remove the beans and paper (save the beans for another time) prick the crust all over with the tines of a fork and bake for another 5 minutes.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.  Meanwhile in a large bowl whisk together the pumpkin brown sugar granulated sugar cinnamon ginger nutmeg salt orange zest eggs cream milk and rum. Pour the filling into the baked pie shell.  Bake for 55 to 65 minutes until the filling is just set in the middle and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Set aside to cool completely. Serve with the rum whipped cream.  Rum Whipped Cream: Place the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sugar mascarpone rum and vanilla. Beat on medium-high until it forms soft peaks. Serve with the pumpkin pie.  NOTE: If you overwhip the cream and it looks curdled just add a little more cream and whip it until it forms soft peaks.

Turn the heat to medium and heat for 10 more minutes (see Read Before Heating! page 25 in Salt Block Cooking: 70 Recipes for Grilling Chilling Searing and Serving on Himalayan Salt Blocks by Mark Bitterman).   Raise the heat to medium-high and heat the block to about 500 degrees F about 10 more minutes. For the last 10 minutes preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (see Getting It Hot page 24 in Salt Block Cooking).  Meanwhile mix the ginger garlic mint and 1 teaspoon of the oil. Season with salt and pepper. Cut three diagonal slices in the sides of both fish. Fill each slit with 1 teaspoon of the ginger mixture. Pack the rest into the fishes' cavities. Rub the remaining 1 teaspoon oil all over the fish.  Using two heavy oven mitts transfer the block to a baking sheet. Put the fish on the hot block and slip the pan into the preheated oven. Roast for 5-minutes then turn over with a metal spatula scraping carefully to avoid tearing the skin. Roast until the flesh of the fish flakes to gentle pressure about 5 more minutes.  Transfer the fish to a serving platter using a wide spatula. Scatter the lime zest over the fish and drizzle with lime juice. Serve removing the fish from the bone at the table.   Serving the Whole Fish: Make a slit through the skin of the cooked fish down the length on the spine right above the dorsal fin using a narrow knife. Insert a spatula into the slit and slide it between the flesh and the bone. Make a slice just behind the head and just in front of the tail separating the top fillet from the skeleton. Lift the released fillet from the carcass and serve.  Using the spatula or two forks lift the central skeleton including the head and the tail from the bottom fillet and discard. Serve the bottom fillet.

Kalua Pork Sliders with Spicy Slaw,Instant Pot,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Kalua Pork Sliders with Spicy Slaw,4 servings,  For the pork: 3 pounds pork shoulder fat trimmed  3 tablespoons red Hawaiian salt or flaky smoked salt plus more to taste 4 cloves garlic peeled and cut into slivers 3 slices thick-cut smoked bacon  3/4 cup water (Refer to your manufacturers' manual to see what the minimum amount of liquid is for your particular model and adjust accordingly.)   For the slaw:  2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar plus more to taste   1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon granulated sugar   1 tablespoon fresh lime juice  3/4 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon garlic-chile sauce like Sriracha more to taste 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil   1/2 small green or red cabbage (about 4 cups) cored and thinly sliced in a mandolin  1 medium carrot julienned  2 green onions thinly sliced  1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds  Sea salt to taste Warm sweet Hawaiian rolls split for serving   ,  Contrary to its name Kahlua pork has no coffee liqueur added; it refers to long slow cooked pig. Kalua pua'a or roast pork is prepared in a Hawaiian imu or underground steam oven. Kalua pork is usually seasoned with sea salt with smokiness coming from the beach fire used to build the heat in the oven. We have created that same texture and flavor with a pressure cooker and a few slices of smoky bacon. For the most authentic flavor we recommend red Hawaiian salt but good flaky salt works well too. The ratio of salt to pork is 1 tablespoon per pound as the pressure cooker intensifies the salty flavor.   For the pork: Evenly sprinkle the pork with salt make several slits in the pork and stuff with the slivered garlic. Heat a pressure cooker to medium-high; when heated add the bacon and cook until crispy about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside reserving the fat. Keeping the temperature at medium-high add the pork to the reserved bacon fat and sear the pork on all sides until golden brown. Add the water and cooked bacon cover lock the lid and heat until pressure is reached. Maintain high pressure according to manufacturers' instructions and cook under pressure for 75 minutes.   Remove from heat or turn off release pressure naturally and remove lid. Transfer the pork to a medium bowl and using two forks shred the pork adding enough of the cooking liquid to keep it juicy. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt.  For the slaw: In a small bowl whisk together vinegar soy sugar lime juice mayonnaise chile sauce and sesame oil until well combined. In a large bowl combine cabbage carrots green onion and sesame seeds. Add dressing and toss to coat; taste and adjust seasoning with additional lime and salt. Slaw will stay crispy 1 to 2 hours refrigerated.   To serve: Assemble the sliders by topping sweet rolls with kalua pork and spicy slaw. Transfer sliders to a large platter and serve.      
Turkish White Beans,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/side-dishes/pasta-grains-legumes/Turkish White Beans,6 servings,  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil plus extra to serve 1 large yellow onion chopped 8 garlic cloves minced 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 tablespoon paprika 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 quart low-sodium chicken broth Kosher salt and ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds boneless beef chuck trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks 1 pound dried small white beans (such as navy)  1 (14 1/2-ounce) can diced tomatoes  1/2 cup minced fresh dill plus extra to serve 2 tablespoon pomegranate molasses (optional)    ,  Normally we soak dry beans overnight before cooking them. But in the pressure cooker we can skip that step with some beans. In this recipe we use dry small white beans (also called navy beans) which cook in the same time as the beef. Pomegranate molasses adds a bright tangy finish to the dish. If you can't find it drizzle the stew with lemon juice. Start timing the beans once the pot has reached high pressure.  Don't soak the white beans for this recipe; they will overcook before the meat is done if they aren't cooked from dry.  In a 5 1/2-liter or larger pressure cooker over medium-high heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook stirring occasionally until lightly browned about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic tomato paste paprika and pepper flakes then cook until fragrant about 30 seconds.  Stir in the broth and 1 tablespoon salt. Stir in the beef and beans. Lock the lid in place and bring to high pressure (second red line). Adjust the heat to low to stabilize pressure at the second red line. Cook for 45 minutes.   Off heat allow the pressure to reduce naturally (about 20 minutes). Carefully open the lid and tilt it away from you to release the residual steam. Stir in the tomatoes cover (do not lock the lid) and let stand for 10 minutes. Stir in the dill and molasses. Taste and season with salt and pepper.   
Creamy Gruyere and Parmesan Risotto,Fagor,home/recipes/side-dishes/pasta-grains-legumes/Creamy Gruyere and Parmesan Risotto,4 servings,  2 tablespoons of sweet butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice 4 cups chicken stock 1 cup crated Gruyere cheese (4 ounces)   3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese Salt and pepper to taste  1/2 cup heavy cream    , Heat the butter oil and garlic in the cooker on the SAUTe setting.

Peach Crostata,Jim Dodge,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Peach Crostata,1 serving,  Dough 1 1/2 cups organic unbleached all-purpose flour 5 oz. cold European or low-moisture unsalted butter 3 tablespoons cold water 1 large egg yolk 1 large egg white beaten until smooth  Filling 5 ripe medium-size peaches (about 2 pounds) 6 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons tapioca flour  , For the dough:  Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper so it lies flat on the pan. Set aside until needed. Adjust oven rack to the lower-third level and preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Add the flour to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Remove the cold butter from the refrigerator and cut into about  3/4"-wide slices. Add the cold butter and salt on top of the flour place cover securely on top and pulse twice to coat the butter chunks with flour.  Process continuously until a coarse meal has formed. The mixture should feel cool and slightly grainy like cornmeal. If there are still large pieces of isolated butter then you need to process a little bit more but be careful not to overmix which would be beyond the coarse-meal stage.  Once the meal is coarse remove the cover. In a small bowl beat the yolk with the 3 tablespoons cold water until smooth. Pour over the top of the coarse meal halfway between the side of the bowl and the center blade. Place the cover on top and continue processing only until a ball forms and rolls around in the bowl twice. Stop the processor.   Lightly dust the top of a smooth counter with extra all-purpose flour. Turn the dough out onto center of the dusted counter. Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour from sifter. Knead the dough gently and quickly just until smooth. Dust lightly with additional flour only as needed to prevent the dough from sticking to the table and your hands.  Form dough into a round disc with smooth edges about 6 inches in diameter. Place the disc of dough on the center of the flour-dusted counter. Keep the counter and top of dough lightly dusted with flour while rolling. Occasionally glide your hand under the dough and rotate it in a circle to ensure it is not sticking to the counter. If the dough begins to stick to the counter or rolling pin that's when you want to dust with more flour. Roll the dough into a 12" circle. Using a dry soft 3-"-wide bristle pastry brush brush off any extra flour from the dough.  Roll the dough around the rolling pin and unroll on parchment-lined cookie sheet.   In a small bowl beat the egg white until smooth. Dip a small pastry brush into the egg white. Paint a thin layer of beaten egg white over the top of the rolled dough. Save the extra beaten egg white for use later.  For the filling:  Wash the peaches in cold water and towel dry. Cut into  1/2"-thick slices. Place slices in a large bowl. In a small bowl  combine the sugar and tapioca stir together until evenly blended. Sprinkle tapioca and sugar mixture over the peaches. Using a rubber spatula or large kitchen spoon fold only until the fruit is covered.   Add the peaches to the center of the dough and evenly spread leaving about a 2 1/2" border. Gently press the peaches to close any large gaps between the slices.   Glide your hand under the edge of the dough about 2 1/2" in and fold halfway toward the center of the filling. Continue this motion making a pleat as you fold each piece of the edge until you have finished and created an outer edge with an open center. Once done lightly paint the top ring of folded dough with egg white. Place in the preheated oven on the lower third rack.  After 30 minutes remove from the oven. Using the back of a large oval soup spoon gently press peaches down to the level of the juices. This will give a simple glaze to the top of the peaches. Return to the oven and reduce heat to 400 degrees F. Continue baking another15-20 minutes until the fruit is tender and the crust is golden brown. Place the pan on a wire rack for even cooling. 
Deep Dish Apple Pie,Breville,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Deep Dish Apple Pie,8 servings,  Pie Dough: 2 3/4 cups flour (12 ounces) (340g) all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 sticks (8 ounces) (226g) cold butter cut into  1/2 inch cubes  1/2 cup (4 ounces) (113 ml) ice water  Filling: 5 pounds apples (2.27kg) peeled cored and sliced  3/4 inch thick (Can use one or more firm tart or sweet-tart varieties such as Granny Smith Pink Lady or Honeycrisp.)  1 cup sugar divided  1/2 cup brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg  1/2 teaspoon ground allspice  1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons butter divided 2 tablespoons cornstarch   ,  Prep time: 40min plus 3.5hrs cooling time Cook time: 75min + 20min for par-cooking the apples   For the dough: In a medium bowl combine flour sugar and salt.  Whisk to mix thoroughly. Add butter and using your fingers rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the butter resembles corn flakes. (If using a food processor pulse dry ingredients to combine add butter and then pulse a few times until mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs.)  Add the ice water and with your hands work the dough until it just comes together.  Be careful not to overwork the dough. (In a food processor add ice water and pulse a few times to distribute the ice water throughout the dough and dough just starts to come together.  It should not completely form into a ball and carousel around the bowl of the processor.)   Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form a ball. Divide the dough in half.  Form each portion into a disk.  Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.  Prepare the filling (instructions below).  While the filling is cooling roll out the bottom crust to about 14 inches (35cm) in diameter and about 1/8 inch thick (3 mm).  Gently fold it in half and drape it in the bottom of the pie dish.  Carefully unfold the crust.  Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes before adding the filling.   While the bottom crust chills roll out the top crust.   Place it in the center of a piece of a large piece of parchment (baking) paper.  Gently fold the crust into quarters.  Use the parchment paper to enclose the folded crust.  Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes.  For the filling: In a small bowl stir together  1/2 cup sugar brown sugar spices salt and cornstarch.  Set aside.    Heat a Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add half of the butter and heat until melted.  Add the apple slices and remaining  1/2 cup sugar toss to coat evenly.  Cook apples over medium heat for about 10 to 20 minutes to slightly soften gently stirring frequently to ensure even cooking.  (Parcooking the apples with sugar will help keep them from becoming mushy during baking and will “pre-shrink” them and prevent the large empty space that often forms beneath the baked crust.)   When the apples are softened using the lid drain off the liquid from the pan and discard.  Add remaining butter and stir to evenly coat the parcooked apples.  Spread the apples onto 1 or 2 rimmed baking sheets in a shallow layer and cool in the refrigerator freezer or on the counter to room temperature.  Set aside the Dutch oven but don't wash it.     After the apples have cooled scrape them back into the Dutch oven and sprinkle with remaining sugar spice and cornstarch mixture.  Stir to coat apples evenly.  To Assemble: Remove the crust-lined pie dish and top crust from the refrigerator.  Set the top crust aside.  Evenly fill the pie dish with the prepared apples.   Remove the quartered top crust from the parchment paper and position it on top of the pie.  Carefully unfold the crust making sure it is pliable and does not crack. (If crust is too cold to unfold without cracking wait another 2 or 3 minutes to unfold it.)   Once the top crust is opened and centered over the dish using kitchen shears or a sharp knife evenly trim the both top and bottom crusts so about  1/2 inch extends beyond the rim.  Crimp together the edges of both crusts.  Refrigerate the pie for about 15 minutes or place in freezer for about 10 minutes to firm up the crusts and prevent them from sagging while baking.  Before baking use a sharp knife to cut 4 or 5 two-inch (5cm) long slits in the top crust to vent the steam.   To Bake: Select BAKE/350 degrees F/CONVECTION. Dial up 1 hour 15 minutes and select ROTATE REMIND. Position wire rack in rack position 8.  When preheating has finished place the chilled pi

Trash fish refers to undervalued underutilized varieties of seafood that are often thrown back into the sea. These lesser-known fish are often by-catch from big-name fish production.   Fish skin is the bacon of the sea. Keep it on while grilling or cook alongside (free snack for the chef).  Joel and Brooke used skinless rockfish. There are a lot of bones so have your fishmonger remove them. The filets are thin but when cooked they stay meaty and firm.  Notes from Ren at Trash Fish: &#8226;If you like salmon you would love wild caught steelhead trout.  &#8226;If you like tuna you would love tuna bycatch.  &#8226;If you like shrimp you should try sea snails whelks or limpets.  Don't let the shell intimidate you. They're cheap easy to cook and protein packed.

Cinnamon-Streusel Sour Cream Coffee Cake,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Cinnamon-Streusel Sour Cream Coffee Cake,1 (10-inch round ) cake,   1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 cup pecans toasted and chopped 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder  1/2 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter softened (65&deg; to 68&deg;F) 2 cups granulated sugar 4 large eggs at room temperature 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1 (16-ounce) container sour cream at room temperature   , The touch of cocoa powder in this streusel tempers the sweetness and adds a subtle depth of flavor-you won't notice it's there but it gives the topping a little extra oomph. Cakes like this one freeze beautifully so you can even make it up to a month in advance. The best accompaniments are a bowl of fresh fruit and a cup of good coffee.   Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and position an oven rack in the lower third. Lightly coat a 10-inch tube pan with a removable bottom with melted butter oil or high-heat canola oil spray dust it with flour and tap out the excess.  To make the streusel place the brown sugar cinnamon and cocoa powder in a medium bowl and stir with a spoon until well blended. Smash any lumps of brown sugar or cocoa so the mixture is even in texture. Add the pecans and stir to blend.  Place the flour baking powder baking soda and salt in a medium bowl and whisk to blend thoroughly.  Put the butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium-high speed until the mixture is very light almost white in color 4 to 5 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl though you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape down the bowl with a spatula.  Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat with a fork to blend. Add the vanilla and beat well. With the mixer running on medium add the eggs to the butter mixture about 1 tablespoon at a time blending well after each addition. About halfway through turn off the mixer and use the spatula to scrape down the bowl; then continue using the rest of the eggs. Scrape down the bowl again.  With the mixer running on the lowest speed add one-third of the dry ingredients. Just as it is barely blended and you can still see a few patches of flour add half of the sour cream. Repeat ending with the dry ingredients. Scrape down the bowl and finish blending the batter by hand.  Spoon half of the batter into a 10-inch tube pan with a removable bottom and smooth the top. Sprinkle half of the streusel evenly over the batter. Spoon the remaining batter into the pan and level and smooth the top. Sprinkle the remaining streusel over the top. Bake for 65 to 75 minutes until the cake is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes if you want to serve it warm or about 1 1/2 hours to cool completely.  Run a thin knife or spatula around the inner tube of the pan to loosen the cake. Lift the center portion of the pan with the cake out of the ring. Run a thin knife or spatula around the bottom of the cake to release it from the bottom of the pan Hold the cake firmly with your hands on both sides. Gently lift the cake sliding it up the tube portion until it comes completely off the pan. Set it on a serving plate. Use a serrated knife to cut slices.  The cake will keep at room temperature for up to 4 days covered with plastic wrap or a cake dome. Once it has been cut press a piece of plastic wrap against the cut edges to keep the interior fresh. The cake can be frozen double wrapped in plastic for up to 4 weeks. Thaw still wrapped in plastic to avoid condensation for 3 hours before serving. Remove the plastic wrap in aluminum foil and reheat in a 325 degrees F oven for 20 minutes or until warmed through.

The risotto is done when it is creamy and the grains are plump and tender with a slight resistance to the bite. Taste and season with salt and white pepper.    Remove from heat and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter sauteed mushrooms and Parmesan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If risotto is thick use any leftover broth to thin as needed.

In this recipe the meat is seasoned with a spice mixture called garam masala and shaped into patties. Make your own spice blend from the recipe at left or buy a prepackaged mixture of whole spices toast in a tawa (or small skillet) and grind in an electric spice grinder as needed.  Make the yogurt sauce: Combine the mint ginger garlic and salt in a large mortar and crush to a paste with a pestle. Alternatively process the mint ginger garlic and salt to a paste in a food processor. Transfer to a serving bowl and fold in the yogurt. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.  Make the kebabs: If using a store-bought whole garam masala blend spread it in a tawa or small heavy skillet. Examine the mixture carefully. If there is more than 1 clove remove the other cloves. Place the tawa over medium heat and heat stirring constantly for 2 to 3 minutes until the spices turn a shade darker and become fragrant. Pour into a small bowl and let cool. Transfer to an electric spice grinder grind to a fine powder and set aside. If using homemade garam masala set it aside.  Combine the ginger garlic and salt in the mortar and crush to a paste with the pestle. Or grate the garlic and ginger with a rasp grater transfer to a saucer and use the back of a fork to mash with the salt until blended.  In the tawa or a medium skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the canola oil over medium-low heat. Add the ginger paste and cook stirring for 1 minute. Add the garam masala and cook stirring for 30 seconds. Transfer the spice mixture to a small bowl. Wash and dry the tawa.  In a blender or food processor combine the onion and water and process to a smooth puree.

At first the mixture may seem too wet but stir it for another 30 seconds and it will tighten. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes.  Line a platter with a double thickness of paper towels. Heat the tawa or skillet over medium heat. Coat the surface with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and heat the oil. Using a measuring tablespoon as a guide scoop up a generous 1-inch ball of meat flatten it slightly to make a patty and carefully place it in the hot oil. Repeat to make more patties being carefully not to crowd the pan and rinsing your hands with cold water as needed to prevent the meat mixture from sticking to them. Fry the patties turning once with a spatula for 2 minutes per side or until nicely browned and cooked through. Transfer the patties to the towel-lined platter to drain. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture in one or two batches.  Serve the patties hot with the yogurt sauce and the chutney.

Total Cooking Time: About 1- 3/4 hours 25 minutes under pressure Pressure Level: High Release: Natural   Weeknight tacos are usually limited to quick-cooking fillings like ground beef but the pressure cooker makes pork butt-which would take hours in the oven-an option.  We combined pork with orange juice chipotle cumin and oregano. After 25 minutes under pressure the pork was fall-apart tender and flavorful. Then we reduced the braising liquid for more depth. Refining the liquid's flavors with a little sugar and some lime juice at the end completed the dish. Pork butt roast is often labeled Boston butt in the supermarket.  High pressure for 25 minutes:  Combine pork water onion halves chipotle oregano sugar cumin 1 teaspoon salt  1/2 teaspoon pepper and bay leaves in pressure-cooker pot. Juice orange into bowl and remove seeds. Add juice from orange halves into pot then add spent halves. Lock pressure-cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat. As soon as pot reaches high pressure reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 25 minutes adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure.  Naturally release pressure:  Remove pot from heat and allow pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes. Quick release any remaining pressure then carefully remove lid allowing steam to escape away from you.  Before serving: Remove onion halves orange halves and bay leaves from cooking liquid. Using large spoon skim excess fat from surface of sauce. Bring pork to simmer and cook breaking up meat into bite-size pieces with wooden spoon until cooking liquid has thickened about 15 minutes. Stir in lime juice and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon mixture on warmed tortillas and serve (wrap tortillas in aluminum foil or a clean dish towel to keep them warm and soft before serving).  Troubleshooting:  Can I use another cut of pork?: Yes you can substitute boneless country-style pork ribs; reduce the pressurized cooking time to 15 minutes. Note that this cut won't shred as well as the pork butt.  Do I need to alter the recipe for a 6-quart electric pressure cooker?: Yes turn the cooker off immediately after the pressurized cooking time and let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes. Do not let the cooker switch to the warm setting. Increase the simmering time to 30 minutes and use the browning (not the simmer) setting.  Alternate recipe:   Shredded Chicken Soft Tacos  Substitute 4 (12-ounce) bone-in split chicken breasts trimmed for pork. Reduce pressurized cooking time to 15 minutes and use quick-release method.    After removing onion orange and bay leaves from pot in step 3 transfer chicken to cutting board let cool slightly and shred meat into bite-size pieces discarding skin and bones. Meanwhile simmer cooking liquid until thickened about 10 minutes. Return shredded chicken to pot with lime juice and let heat through before serving.

Buttercream Frosting,Recipe Developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Buttercream Frosting,12 cups,  12 large egg whites at room temperature  21 ounces (3 cup) granulated sugar  3 pounds (12 sticks) unsalted butter chilled cut into 1-inch pieces  1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste vanilla extract or almond extract   3/4 teaspoon fine kosher salt   , Velvety smooth buttercream is the king of frostings. This version is a Swiss meringue buttercream which simply means that the egg whites and sugar are heated together before beating. The buttercream can also be flavored in many ways which makes it very versatile. Any leftover frosting freezes beautifully; it simply needs to be thawed to room temperature and re-whipped to be used another day.  To the bowl of a stand mixer add egg whites and sugar; whisk to blend. Bring 2 inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Place the bowl with the whites and sugar over the simmering water and heat whisking constantly until the mixture reaches 145 degrees F (hot to the touch) on an instant-read thermometer. Remove mixture from the heat and attach bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip the mixture on high speed until it cools to room temperature is light and billowing and resembles marshmallow fluff. If the mixture is warm it will melt the butter. Test the temperature of the meringue by touching the bottom outside of the bowl it should feel room temperature.  Replace whisk attachment with paddle attachment. With the mixer on medium-high speed add chilled butter a couple of tablespoons at a time allowing each addition to blend in fully before adding the next. Halfway through adding the butter stop the mixer and use a silicone spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl thoroughly. Continue to whip until all the butter has been added and the mixture is velvety and smooth. Add the vanilla bean paste and salt whip to incorporate.   Keep buttercream in airtight container in refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Let come to room temperature and rewhip in the mixer with the paddle attachment before using.

Sous Vide Brussels Sprouts with Pearl Onions,Sansaire,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Sous Vide Brussels Sprouts with Pearl Onions,1 serving,  Brussels Sprouts: 6 cups Brussels sprouts halved with outer leaves removed 2 cups butter cubed&#8727 6 cloves garlic smashed 1 teaspoon Tabasco&#174; (Chipotle flavor)   3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  Pearl Onions: 4 cups pearl or Cipollini onions 4 tablespoons butter cubed&#8727;  3/4 cup golden raisins 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  &#8727;If you aren't using a vacuum sealer melt the butter before bagging then use the water displacement method to remove air from the bag to seal (see below for details).  , Celebrated by chefs from Heston Blumenthal to Thomas Keller cooking sous vide calls for slowly heating vacuum-sealed food in water at low temperatures locking in natural juices and flavors lost with other methods. The Sansaire Sous-Vide immersion circulator makes it easy to prepare dishes in advance and deliver them piping-hot to the table.  This recipe was tested with the Sansaire immersion water circulator. Please consult your owner's manual for proper cooking times food handling and safety procedures.   Brussels Sprouts: Preheat your water bath to 185 degrees F (85 degrees C).   Toss all ingredients together in a large bowl to combine.   Transfer ingredients to a 1-gallon vacuum bag and seal with vacuum sealer.*  Cook sprouts in the water bath until they are tender about 1 hour. When done carefully transfer onto a platter and serve immediately.   If making ahead of time remove the bag from the bath and chill quickly by plunging it into a bowl of ice water. Store refrigerated for up to 5 days.  &#8727;Using the water displacement method: If you aren't using a vacuum sealer melt the butter before adding to the other ingredients. With the top of the bag open use tongs to carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out and form a seal around the vegetables. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag.  Pearl Onions: Preheat your water bath to 185 degrees F (85 degrees C). You may also cook in the same bath as the Brussels sprouts.  Toss all ingredients together in a large bowl to combine.   Transfer ingredients to a 1-gallon vacuum bag and seal with vacuum sealer or use water displacement method.   Cook onions until they are tender about 1 hour. When done carefully transfer onto a platter and serve immediately.    Note: If making ahead of time remove the bag from the bath and chill quickly by plunging it into a bowl of ice water. Store refrigerated for up to 5 days then reheat when ready to serve.   Get the recipe for Sous Vide Turkey Breast with Dark Meat Confit and Gravy »

Cedar-Plank Salmon with Maple-Mustard Glaze,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Cedar-Plank Salmon with Maple-Mustard Glaze,4 servings,  2 cedar planks 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 3 tablespoons lemon juice divided Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (5 ounce) salmon fillets skin-on and pin-bones removed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper   , Cedar wood imparts the salmon with a lush and smoky aromatic flavor. When cooking with planks they need to be immersed in water at least one hour prior to grilling as the water produces a maximum smoke flavor and makes the plank more resistant to charring on the grill. If using a plank for the first time season the plank by placing it on a preheated grill for 2 minutes turning once. Lightly toasting the plank on both sides will intensify its smoky flavor and prevent warping. When the plank starts crackling it’s ready for cooking.  Fully submerge cedar planks in cold water at least one hour prior to cooking. Preheat a grill to medium or preheat an oven to 375 degrees F and place a rack in the center.  In a small bowl combine the maple syrup mustard oil and juice. Set aside.  Remove the soaked cedar plank from the water and place on a grill rack. Close the grill and allow the board to heat for a few minutes until it begins to smoke and crackle.   Using a silicone brush lightly coat the top of the salmon with the maple-mustard mixture and season with salt and pepper. Using tongs arrange the salmon on the cedar planks. Cover the grill and cook until salmon is flaky about 8 to 10 minutes for 1-inch thick filets. Transfer salmon to warmed dinner plate and serve immediately.

Bucatini with Peas Kale and Pancetta,by ;One-Pan Wonders&lt;/i&gt;,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Bucatini with Peas Kale and Pancetta,4 to 6 servings,   1/2 cup panko bread crumbs toasted 1 1/2 ounces Parmesan cheese grated ( 3/4 cup)  1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest Salt and pepper 2 ounces pancetta cut into  1/2-inch pieces 2 garlic cloves minced  1/2 cup dry white wine 2  1/2 cups water 2 cups chicken broth 1 pound Bucatini 5 ounces (5 cups) baby kale 1 cup frozen peas   , Salty pancetta and fresh sweet peas are a classic combination and make a great base for pasta which eagerly takes up the pancetta's rich flavors. Add in hearty but quick-cooking baby kale and you have a simple fresh pasta dish with a meaty backbone. For our pasta we opted for thick-stranded bucatini similar to spaghetti but hollow which allowed the pasta to absorb plenty of flavorful sauce. To build our base we first rendered the pancetta reserving the crispy pieces for garnish and using the fat to bloom bright lemon zest and garlic. Then we added white wine chicken broth and water to build a savory cooking liquid for our pasta. As the liquid simmered down and our pasta approached doneness we stirred in baby kale and peas letting everything finish together. A quick vigorous stir with the addition of some Parmesan at the end of cooking bound the now-reduced liquid into a cheesy cohesive sauce. For a flavorful topping and some crunchy contrast we topped off each serving with a mixture of panko Parmesan and lemon zest as well as the crisped pancetta. You can substitute 1 pound of spaghetti for the bucatini if desired.  Combine toasted panko  3/4 cup Parmesan oil 1 teaspoon lemon zest  3/4 teaspoon salt and  3/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl. Cook pancetta in Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp 6 to 8 minutes; transfer to paper towel–lined plate.  Add garlic and remaining 2 teaspoons zest to fat left in pot and cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Stir in wine scraping up any browned bits and cook until nearly evaporated about 3 minutes. Stir in water and broth scraping up any browned bits.  Increase heat to high and bring to boil. Stir in pasta reduce heat to medium and simmer vigorously stirring often until pasta is nearly tender 8 to 10 minutes.  Stir in kale and peas and continue to simmer until pasta and kale are tender about 4 minutes. Add remaining  1/2 cup Parmesan and stir vigorously until pasta is creamy and well coated about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve sprinkling individual portions with crisp pancetta and bread-crumb mixture.

Pressure Cooker Sweet and Spicy Chicken Tinga,Urvashi Pitre ;www.twosleevers.com&lt;/i&gt;,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Pressure Cooker Sweet and Spicy Chicken Tinga,6 servings,  1 tablespoon oil 2 tomatillos  1/2 onion 4 cloves garlic  1/3 cup chicken broth 7 ounces fire roasted tomatoes 1 chipotle chile with adobo sauce  1/2 teaspoons ground cumin  1/3 teaspoons ground cinnamon  1/2 teaspoons dried oregano 1 teaspoon sugar or other sweetener 1 tablespoon fish sauce or soy sauce 1 tablespoon cider vinegar 1 1/2 pounds chicken thighs   , Instant Pot Chicken Tinga is a sweet spicy and utterly delicious authentic Mexican dish. Use is as a filling for tacos or eat it plain with some guacamole. Delicious either way.  Heat the Instant Pot on Saute and once it's hot add oil.   Put down tomatillo slices in a single layer on one side add onions in as flat a layer as possible on the other and nestle in the garlic cloves. You're going to let these char so do not move these for a while.  Once the thinner slices start to look a little burned flip the vegetables. The bottom of your pot will have large black spots where the vegetables have burned but this is a good thing.  Once the vegetables seemed well charred add in the tomatoes and broth and deglaze the pan scraping up all the lovely brown bits.  Add all the other ingredients except chicken and cook for 1-2 minutes to allow the spices to bloom.  Add in chicken close and seal the lid and set your Instant Pot to 15 mins HP or use the Poultry setting. Let is release pressure naturally when done.  Open and remove chicken pieces and shred.  Using an immersion blender emulsify the sauce in the pot until the mixture is smooth. You may have to tilt the pot to get all the sauce to one side.  Turn the pot on saute and start to thicken the sauce for 10 minutes. You want a thick sauce coating the chicken so it won't drip out thinly as it is added to the tortilla. Once it's thickened a bit add in the chicken and heat through.  Serve with corn tortillas as a taco filling or over rice or cauliflower rice for a low-carb option.  Top with chopped cilantro crema finely chopped red onions shredded cabbage or avocado slices.  Recipe from www.twosleevers.com by Urvashi Pitre author of Indian Instant Pot Cookbook.

Press the seam firmly to seal while at the same time pressing out any air bubbles.  Set aside on the prepared tray. Make the remaining 23 dumplings in the same way.   Set up a steamer. Lightly oil the steamer plate or line with cabbage or lettuce leaves or a lightly oiled parchment round. Arrange the dumplings in the steamer leaving a little space in between them so that they do not stick together and steam for about 10 minutes. Depending on your steaming set up you may need to steam them in batches. Serve piping hot with Ponzu sauce.  Variation: For a non-vegetarian version replace the wakame with 1 cup additional chopped green onions or leeks and replace the edamame with 1  1/2 cups ground pork-the remaining ingredients and procedures remain the same. You can also use these dumplings to make pot-stickers.

Curried Noodle Bowl,Gina Fontana,home/recipes/main-courses/vegetarian/Curried Noodle Bowl, 2-3,  8-10 oz. rice noodles (I used pad thai) 5 oz. marinated shiitake mushrooms (see below) Panko-crusted tofu (see below) 1 bunch kale ( I used Lacinato kale) 1 Tbsp. red curry paste  3/4 cup gluten-free low-sodium tamari sauce 1 tsp. minced garlic Sugar snap peas Sesame seeds Avocado (optional) Fresh ginger (optional)   Marinated Mushrooms (mushrooms adapted from Lauren Caris Cooks)  5 oz. shiitake mushrooms  1/3 cup gluten-free low-sodium tamari sauce 1 tsp. sriracha chili sauce 1 tsp. curry powder 1 Tbsp. maple syrup   Panko-Crusted Tofu   1/2 block extra-firm tofu  3/4 cup gluten-free low-sodium tamari sauce  3/4- 1/2 cup gluten-free tempura (or rice flour) 1 cup gluten-free panko breadcrumbs   Himalayan salt bowl from Sur La Table , Preheat your oven to 200 degrees and place the Himalayan salt bowl on a baking sheet and place in the oven.  Then marinate your mushrooms by tossing them with all the marinade ingredients in a bowl. Place in the fridge while you make your panko tofu  Drain and press your tofu and cut in half (I buy the pre-pressed tofu and it's great!) Then cut into large chunks or strips.  Place the tempura panko and tamari sauce into 3 separate bowls.   Heat a nonstick skillet to medium heat and add about  3/4 cup of sesame oil (or other cooking oil). I used a cast iron skillet (I find it really helps with non-sticking).  As the oil heats coat each tofu pieces in the tempura (or rice flour) first then in the tamari sauce (make sure your tofu pieces absorb it) and then finally coat it evenly with panko crumbs. Set aside while you coat the rest of your tofu pieces.  Place your panko-covered tofu in the skillet and fry a couple minutes per side. When golden remove and place on a paper-towel-lined plate. NOTE: You can place your panko tofu on a baking sheet in the oven to keep it warm.  Heat a nonstick skillet (you can clean and use the same skillet you used to make the panko tofu) to medium heat. Add the marinated mushrooms (marinade and all) and saute them for 5-7 minutes tossing a couple times.  Dice your kale into large pieces (I like mine a little bigger but feel free to cut them how you prefer-just keep in mind they will shrink as they cook) and place them into the skillet with the mushrooms along with 1 tsp. minced garlic. Toss to combine.  Now boil your water to make the noodles add some oil to the water to help them not stick together. Cook the noodles according to package directions making sure you stir often to avoid the noodles sticking together.  Drain your noodles and add back to the pot with 1 tbsp. red curry paste and  3/4 cup gluten-free low-sodium tamari sauce. Toss to coat the noodles. You can add more tamari sauce or a little water if your noddles are too dry.  Add the mushroom kale mixture to the pot with the pasta toss.  Take your panko tofu out of the oven along with the salt bowl. Be careful; the salt bowl will be very hot so use pot holders when handling.   Place the pasta in the salt bowl(s) and top with pea pods panko-crusted tofu sesame seeds avocado and shredded ginger (if using).  NOTE: The salt bowl will keep your pasta warm and will also add salt to the noodles. The longer the pasta sits in the bowl the more salt will be absorbed into the food

To assemble the cake place one layer on a rotating cake stand. Use an offset spatula to swirl frosting over the cake layer. Transfer 1 cup of frosting to a large piping bag and pipe a ring of frosting around the outer edge of the cake layer. Use a spoon to spread about 3 tablespoons of citrus curd in the center of the cake layer. Add second cake layer and repeat with frosting and citrus curd. Add top cake layer and chill for 20 minutes.  Use offset spatula to apply a layer of frosting to the top and sides of the cake while you rotate the cake stand then use a bench scraper to gently smooth the edges of the cake and remove any excess frosting.  To decorate the cake transfer Cake Craft Metallic Drizzle to a squeeze bottle and decorate as desired. Top cake with dipped meringues and citrus fruit.

Cook stirring occasionally until onions are soft about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes and red pepper flakes. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Let sauce simmer quite furiously stirring occasionally to let the liquid cook down about 20 minutes. Lower the heat if the sauce starts to stick. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Stir in dried oregano just prior to using. If the sauce tastes a little sour add a pinch or two of sugar to your taste. Transfer tomato sauce to a small mixing bowl. Set aside.  To prepare the sausage:    Place a large skillet over medium heat and add sausage. Cook breaking sausages into small pieces with a wooden spoon until sausage is cooked through about 5 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or spider transfer sausage pieces to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.  To roll out your dough:    Once your stone is preheated you can start rolling out your dough. Dust your work surface with flour. Flatten one dough ball to a thickness of  1/2 inch and roll to a diameter of about 5 inches keeping the remaining dough covered. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with another piece of parchment. Continue rolling dough balls and placing on the baking sheet separating layers of rolled dough with additional sheets of parchment as needed. Cover stack of dough rounds with plastic wrap and set aside.  To prepare the pizza:    Sprinkle a pizza peel with some cornmeal and place a dough round on the peel. Give the peel a little shake to make sure that the dough moves freely and is not sticking. Lightly spread about 2 to 3 tablespoons of sauce onto the dough. Sprinkle the dough with cooked sausage broccoli rabe and mozzarella pieces.  To bake the pizza:    Working quickly open the oven and slide the pizza off the peel onto the pizza stone. Allow your pizza to cook until the crust is golden brown and crisp and the cheese is bubbling about 8 to 10 minutes.   To serve:    Remove the pizza from the oven and place on a cutting board. If you let the pizza rest for 1 to 2 minutes before you cut it you will get prettier pieces.

Rather seek out the orphaned firm and completely underripe tomatoes that hang on the vines in every gardener's vegetable patch for they are the desired tomatoes for this recipe. With fresh chiles and early fall apples also peaking at this time of year this chutney is a seasonal delight to share with friends. Choose fresh chiles that deliver a real heat kick or make milder-flavored chutney by using red-skinned Anaheim chiles.  Combine the tomatoes onions apples garlic vinegar sugar honey mustard seeds salt ginger and allspice in a large Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat stirring occasionally. Decrease to a simmer and cook uncovered for 30 minutes. As the mixture simmers use a wooden spoon to push down the tomatoes so they become immersed in the liquid.  Add the chiles and currants and continue to simmer until the chutney is thick and the liquid is reduced 30 to 45 minutes longer.  While the chutney is simmering prepare the preserving jars and bring water to a boil in a water bath canner.  Remove the chutney from the heat. Using a wide-mouth funnel and filling one jar at a time ladle the chutney into hot sterilized jars leaving  1/2-inch headspace. Remove any air bubbles by running a long wooden utensil such as a chopstick or wooden skewer between the jar and the chutney. Wipe the rims clean. Seal according to the manufacturer's directions. Process the jars in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and then turn off the heat. Wait 5 minutes and then lift the canning rack and using a canning jar lifter transfer the jars to a towel-lined sturdy rimmed baking sheet and let them rest. Check the seals wipe the jars and label.  Storing: Store the jars in a cool dark place for up to 1 year.

Chicken Broth with a Bonus,Things Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Marie Simmons photography by Ben Fink,home/recipes/soups-stews/broth-stocks/Chicken Broth with a Bonus,2 to 2 1/2 quarts plus 3 cups cooked chicken meat,  1 (4-pound) whole chicken with giblets cut up Coarse salt 1 large carrot peeled and quartered crosswise 1 stalk celery with leafy top attached quartered crosswise 1 yellow onion quartered 2 whole cloves 6 cloves garlic bruised with knife 2 leafy sprigs fresh Italian parsley 1 stem thyme 6 black peppercorns   , For this excellent chicken broth select a whole chicken that gives you both the neck and giblets to add flavor to your broth. Ask the butcher to cut up the chicken for you or cut it up yourself with a poultry shears or sturdy kitchen scissors. If only cut-up chicken is available buy extra chicken backs to add to the broth to make up for the absence of the neck and giblets. Plan to make the broth at least several hours before you need it so it can be chilled and the fat which will solidify on the surface can be easily lifted off. The broth freezes well. Store it in 1- or 2-cup containers for convenience.  Place the chicken in a large deep bowl. Add the neck and all the giblets except the liver; reserve the liver for another use. Add  1/2 cup of coarse salt. Cover the chicken with cold water and refrigerate for 1 hour. Drain and rinse the chicken. Transfer the chicken to a stockpot and add water to barely cover (about 3 quarts).  Add the carrot celery onion cloves garlic parsley thyme and peppercorns to the stockpot. Set the pot over low heat cover and heat slowly until just barely simmering. Uncover and watch the pot. As foam rises to the top skim it off with a fine-mesh skimmer or perforated spoon.  Cook the chicken in the barely simmering water over low heat for about 35 minutes. Use a Chinese mesh strainer or a perforated spoon to lift the legs thighs and breasts from the broth and place them on a deep platter leaving the remaining pieces in the pot. Continue to cook the broth uncovered over low heat.  Let the chicken cool for about 20 minutes or until it can be easily handled. Then pull the skin off the meat reserving the skin. Pull or cut the cooked chicken from the bones in pieces and reserve separately. Add the bones any gristle and the reserved skin to the simmering broth. Continue to cook uncovered over low heat for 2 hours longer or until the broth is reduced to about 2 quarts.  Remove the pot from the heat and let the broth stand for 1 to 2 hours until lukewarm. Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth and place over a large bowl. Or place a chinois over a large bowl. Strain the broth and discard the solids.  If there isn't room in the refrigerator for the bowl of broth divide it among smaller bowls or other containers. Cover and refrigerate the broth for several hours or overnight or until is well chilled and the fat has solidified on the surface. Lift off the fat using the fine-mesh sieve. The broth will keep tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months.  Use the delicious cooked chicken meat in sandwiches salads soups or as a filling for crepes.

Bake at 320 degrees F for about 10 minutes until a nice golden brown color is achieved.  Assembly of the recipe: Garnish the molds with the financier batter and sprinkle with candied orange peel cubes and baked streusel. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 15 to 20 minutes. Allow to cool before removing from the molds. Pastry Chef's Tip: In order to keep the streusel and orange peel stable on the surface first bake the financier cakes plain for 4 minutes and then sprinkle the streusel and orange peel on top.   Finish baking for another 10 minutes.  Good to know: Silicon molds don't usually need to be buttered; however if the cakes get stuck in the molds allow the molds to cool and then remove them.

Sous Vide Rosemary-Infused Apple and Lemon Fennel Salad with Gorgonzola,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/salads/fruit-vegetable/Sous Vide Rosemary-Infused Apple and Lemon Fennel Salad with Gorgonzola,4 servings,  2 Granny Smith apples peeled and sliced into 1/8" slices 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice  2 teaspoons honey 1 large fennel bulb root ends trimmed and sliced into 1/8" slices 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons thyme leaves  1/2 teaspoon salt  3/4 teaspoon white pepper 4 cups spring mix salad greens 2 ounces Gorgonzola cheese crumbled   , Celebrated by chefs from Heston Blumenthal to Thomas Keller cooking sous vide calls for slowly heating vacuum-sealed food in water at low temperatures locking in natural juices and flavors lost with other methods.   The color and flavor of cooking vegetables using sous-vide technology is unparalleled to standard cooking methods. Sous vide cooking allows us to cook at a temperature a bit below the boiling point of water so there is less risk of under overcooking your vegetables. Furthermore sealing the vegetables before cooking in a water bath helps retain the natural plant sugars which would otherwise be diluted into a large volume of cooking water. That means brighter color and fuller flavor every time.  This recipe was tested with the Sansaire immersion water circulator. Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device's owner's manual for proper cooking times food handling and safety procedures.   Place apple slices rosemary leaves 1 tablespoon lemon juice and honey into a food saver bag. Seal bag and let sit for 30-60 minutes for apples to absorb flavors.  Choose a pot large enough to hold the fennel with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the pot using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator turning the silver temperature ring above the display to 132 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.  Season the fennel slices with olive oil 2 tablespoons lemon juice thyme salt and white pepper. Place the fennel into a Ziploc bag so that the slices are flat within the bag. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the pot without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the vegetables. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag and leave the fennel to circulate in the water until tender about 40 minutes. Using tongs carefully remove the fennel from the pot and place on a plate.   To serve: Place salad greens in serving bowl. Add the apple and fennel including all juices into the bowl with greens. Add Gorgonzola and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately.  Discover more about sous vide cooking with the Sansaire:  Click here »  
Homemade Laminated Dough,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/breads/dough/Homemade Laminated Dough,about 24 croissants,  Dough Block (Detrempe):  1/2 cup (4 ounces) warm whole milk (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)  1 teaspoon plus 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) sugar divided 4 teaspoons (3/8 ounce) active dry yeast or 1 tablespoon instant yeast 4 cups (20 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon salt  1/2 stick (2 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into small pieces 1 cup (8 ounces) cold milk  Butter Block (Beurrage): 3  1/2 sticks (14 ounces) cold unsalted butter 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unbleached all-purpose flour	   , Layer upon layer of butter and dough produce the ultimate French breakfast treat. This pastry classic dates back to 1686 when Austrian bakers created this treat to commemorate a military victory over Turkey.  To prepare the dough block: Pour the warm milk into a small bowl and whisk in 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Whisk in the yeast and set aside for 10 minutes or until the yeast is activated and the mixture is bubbling.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment combine the flour remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar the salt and cold butter pieces. Blend on medium speed until the butter is cut into tiny pieces and the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Add the yeast mixture and the cold milk. Switch to a dough hook and mix on lowest speed for 1  1/2 to 2 minutes until the liquid is absorbed and has formed a very rough mass. Dust a work surface lightly with flour and turn the dough out onto it. Knead the dough 3 to 5 times just to finish bringing it together. The dough will not be smooth or elastic; it will become fully kneaded and smooth during the rolling and turning process ahead. Don't overwork the dough now or you'll have trouble rolling it later. Wrap the dough loosely in plastic wrap (to allow a little room for expansion) and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes.  To prepare butter block: Cut the butter into  1/2-inch pieces toss with the flour and refrigerate for 20 minutes. In the cleaned stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the floured butter on medium speed scraping down the bowl once or twice with a bowl scraper for 1 to 2 minutes until the butter and flour form a smooth mass. You are not trying to beat air into the mixture just make it pliable and smooth while keeping it cold. Scrape the butter onto a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap wrap it up and refrigerate while you roll out the dough.  To incorporate the butter into the dough: Dust the work surface with flour. Set the dough in the center and dust the top with flour. Roll the dough into a 15 by 12-inch rectangle with a short side parallel to the edge of your work surface. Gently pull or stretch the dough to form straight edges and sharp corners. Brush any flour from the surface. Visually divide the dough crosswise into 3 equal 5-inch wide sections (you can lightly mark the dough with a ruler or the back of a knife if you wish). Spread the cold but pliable butter evenly over the top two sections of dough leaving the bottom third empty and leaving a  1/2-inch border around the edges of the buttered sections. This is best done with your fingers since the butter isn't quite warm enough to spread easily with a spatula. Alternatively you can place the butter between two sheets of plastic and roll it into a 9  1/2 by 11-inch rectangle. Peel off one sheet of plastic invert the buttered rectangle over the dough rectangle center it and peel off the other sheet of plastic.  To encase the butter with a letter fold (First turn): Fold the empty bottom third up over the center third of the dough. Then fold the top third down over the center. Pinch together the seams along the bottom and sides of the dough. Roll your rolling pin across the top briefly and gently 3 or 4 times to help seal the seams. This completes both the incorporation of the butter and your first turn of the dough. If the butter has become warm and squishy wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour before continuing with the second turn. If you have worked quickly and the butter is still cold yet pliable continue with the next turn.  Book fold (Second turn): Position the dough with the short side parallel to your work surface and the long fold on your left. Dust the dough with flour and roll it into a 20 by 12-inch rectangle. Brush any flour from the surface of the dough. Fold the dough using the book fold method: Fold the two short  
Brioche in the Pressure Oven,Wolfgang Puck,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Brioche in the Pressure Oven,2 (8- by 4-inch) loaves,  1 tablespoon active dry yeast 1 cup milk  1/2 cup granulated sugar 3 cups all-purpose flour 3 cups bread flour  1/2 teaspoon salt 10 large cage-free eggs at room temperature 1 pound cold unsalted butter cut into small cubes   , Originating in France brioche is a light and slightly sweet bread made with a rich yeast dough that bakes well in a pressure oven.  Recipe adapted for the Wolfgang Puck Pressure Oven. Please consult your owner's manual for proper use and safety procedures.  In a medium bowl whisk yeast and milk together until dissolved.  Stir in sugar and 1 cup all-purpose flour to form a thick batter.  Cover with plastic wrap and leave in warm environment for 45 minutes.  In a separate mixing bowl add the rest of the all-purpose flour the bread flour the salt and the dry yeast mix.  Put the bowl on the mixer with paddle attachment.  Add the eggs into the bowl and mix at low speed until the eggs are absorbed about 2 minutes.  Increase the speed to medium and knead the dough for 5 minutes.   While continuing to mix at medium speed gradually add the cold butter two tablespoons at a time.  Stop the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Continue mixing at medium speed until the dough is smooth and shiny about 5 minutes.   Transfer the dough to a larger bowl coated with a little oil cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature to rise until doubled in size about 2 hours.  When the dough has doubled in size press down on it to deflate folding it over onto itself 2 or 3 times.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.  Coat the inside of 2 loaf pans with cooking spray.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.  Divide the dough in half; cover 1 piece with plastic wrap while you shape the other.  Dust the top of the dough with all-purpose flour.  With a rolling pin roll the dough into a rectangle the length of the loaf pan and twice its width.  With your hands starting from a short side roll up the dough jellyroll style.  Pinch the seams together.   Place the dough with its long seam down into the prepared pan gently working the dough into the pan with your fingers so it touches all sides.  The dough should reach halfway up the side of the pan. To make the second loaf repeat the above steps with the remaining piece of dough.  Spray some cooking spray or oil on top of the loaves and then cover with plastic wrap.  Set aside at room temperature until the dough has doubled in size to fill the pans completely about 1- 1/2 hours.  Towards the end of this rising period preheat the pressure oven to 400 degrees F and set to BAKE. Position the rack in the bottom of the oven.  Make the egg wash:  In a small bowl whisk together 1 egg with a pinch of salt and 1 tablespoon of water. Gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash.  Place the loaves in the oven and set the timer to bake for 30 minutes. After 8 minutes reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F.  Remove the loaves from the oven and let cool completely before slicing.

Irish Apple and Parsnip Soup,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/soups-stews/vegetarian/Irish Apple and Parsnip Soup,4 servings,  4 ounces unsalted butter 1 large shallot minced 1 leek (white part only) halved lengthwise washed and dried cut into  3/4 inch pieces 1 clove garlic crushed 1 large ( 3/4-pound) Yukon Gold potato peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 2 parsnips (about  1/2-pound) peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 2 Granny Smith apples peeled cored and chopped into 2-inch pieces 5 cups vegetable broth 2 cups apple juice 1 cup whole milk  1/2 cup flat leaf parsley Kosher salt and freshly black pepper   , Parsnips and turnips were used extensively in rural Ireland to give variety to meals in the winter when green vegetables were in little supply. Surprisingly this vegetarian soup is a wonderful balance of sweet apple flavors with parsnip overtones. I prefer to use Granny Smith apples as they have a little more acidic flavor which rounds out the richness of this soup. Serve soup on its own or with a slice of Irish soda bread.  Place a large saucepan on the stove over a medium heat. Add the butter and when melted add shallots leeks and garlic and using a wooden spoon to occasionally stir. Cook until leeks are tender about 7 minutes.   Add the potato parsnips and apples and cook until just potatoes are starting to soften about 5 minutes.   Add the broth and apple juice; reduce stove temperature to a simmer. Cover the saucepan and cook until the vegetables are very soft about 30 minutes.   Remove the saucepan from the heat add the parsley and using a blender or an immersion blender thoroughly puree the mixture.  Return the saucepan to the stove over a medium-low heat and stir in the milk. Heat the soup stirring occasionally until the soup is heated through and boils. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Stuffed Butternut Squash,Jacques Pepin,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Stuffed Butternut Squash,4 servings,  1 butternut squash (about 2 3/4 pounds)  3 1/2 tablespoons canola oil 7 to 8 scallions trimmed (leaving some green) and minced (1 cup)  3 garlic cloves crushed and finely chopped (2 teaspoons)  1 1/2 teaspoons chopped freshly peeled ginger  1/2 teaspoon salt  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 slices firm white bread (about 2 ounces) processed to crumbs in a food processor (1 cup)    ,  The stuffing for this squash is made primarily of the flesh of the squash itself with garlic a bit of ginger and minced scallions added for flavor. (If you are not fond of ginger use less of it or eliminate it altogether.) Bread crumbs tossed with a little oil and sprinkled on top of the filling become brown and crisp in the oven and their crunchiness contrasts nicely with the filling.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Split the squash lengthwise in half and remove the seeds. Score the flesh of the squash making  1/2-inch-deep cuts through it one way and then the other in a crosshatch pattern. Arrange the squash halves cut side up on a cookie sheet and bake for about 1 hour until the flesh is tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.  Meanwhile heat 2 tablespoons of the canola oil in a large skillet. When it is hot add the scallions and saute for 1 1/2 minutes. Mix in the garlic and ginger and set the pan aside.  When the squash is cool enough to handle use a spoon to gently scoop the flesh from the shells leaving walls about  3/4 inch thick and add it to the scallions along with the salt and pepper. Mix well stirring until the squash flesh and scallions are combined but the mixture is still chunky. Fill the squash shells with the mixture.  Lightly mix the bread crumbs with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a small bowl and sprinkle over the stuffed squash. Arrange the squash halves on a cookie sheet and bake for about 20 minutes (a little longer if the stuffing was cool). The crumb mixture should be nicely browned; if it is not place the squash under a hot broiler for a few minutes.  Cut each of the squash halves in half again and serve. (The skin of the squash is edible.)   
Slow-Roasted Tomatoes with Oregano and Feta,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Slow-Roasted Tomatoes with Oregano and Feta,8 servings,  4 large slicing tomatoes about  1/2-pound each Kosher or sea salt  3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano 2 cloves garlic finely minced 2 to 3 ounces Greek French Bulgarian or Israeli feta cheese   , Baking tomatoes slowly in a low oven caramelizes their sugars and concentrates their sweetness. They remain moist-not chewy like sun-dried tomatoes-but with their flavor intensified. Strew them with grated feta while they are warm and serve them with lamb chops roast chicken or a bulgur pilaf. Andrew Brait who oversees tomato production at California’s Full Belly Farm loves Brandywine and Cherokee Purple heirloom varieties and the hybrid Early Girl. You can also use Roma-type tomatoes such as San Marzano. Leftover roasted tomatoes are sublime on a sandwich. The warm feta-topped roasted tomatoes are good chopped and tossed with pasta too.  Preheat the oven to 300&deg;F. Core the tomatoes then cut them in half horizontally. Put the 8 halves cut side up in a baking dish just large enough to hold them. Sprinkle generously with salt. Combine the olive oil oregano (crumbling the herb between your fingers as you add it) and garlic then spoon the mixture over the tomatoes dividing it evenly.  Bake the tomatoes basting every half hour or so until they are very soft and just beginning to caramelize about 3 hours.  Using an offset spatula transfer the tomatoes to a serving platter spooning any pan juices over them. Grate the feta over them. Serve warm not hot.

All-American Apple Pie,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/All-American Apple Pie,1 (9-inch) pie, Flaky Pie Dough  2  1/2 cups (363 grams) all-purpose flour unbleached  1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) salt 14 tablespoons (196 grams) salted or unsalted butter cut into tablespoon-size pieces  1/2 cup (118 grams) ice water + 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 grams) more as needed Additional flour for rolling out dough  6 to 7 (2  1/2 pounds) medium to large Granny Smith apples peeled cored and cut into  3/4-inch slices  1/2 cup (2  3/4-ounces) plus 2 teaspoons granulated sugar divided 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  1/8 teaspoon allspice 1 large egg yolk 1 tablespoon milk or cream Good-quality vanilla ice cream for serving   , Preheat the oven to 400 degrees  F and position a rack in the lower third.   To prepare the dough: Put all ingredients but the ice water in a large bowl.  With clean hands quickly mash the mixture together or use a pastry blender with an up and down motion until the ingredients look like cracker crumbs with lumps the size of peas and almonds. These lumps will make your crust flaky.  Sprinkle ice water over the mixture and stir lightly with a fork. Squeeze a handful of dough to see if it holds together. Mix in more water as needed.   Divide the dough in half and make two chubby discs about 5 inches (12 centimeters) across. Wrap the discs separately in plastic wrap and chill for about an hour.  To prepare pie shell: Lightly flour a work surface and draw a 12-inch circle in the flour. This guide will be the perfect size for a standard 9-inch pie dish. Place 1 recipe of pastry dough in the center of the circle and dust a little flour on top. Using the circle as a guide roll out the dough into a 12-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over a 9-inch pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Trim the dough so that it overhangs by 1-inch. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.   To prepare filling: Taste the apples; if they are very tart you may want to increase the sugar by 2 or 3 tablespoons. In a large bowl gently toss the apples with 1/3 cup sugar (or more to taste) the lemon juice cinnamon and allspice until evenly coated.  Transfer the filling to the pie shell and press down firmly on the apples with the spatula to eliminate some of the air pockets. Scrape any sugar or spices left in the bottom of the bowl over the top of the apples.  Lightly flour a work surface and draw a 12-inch circle in the flour. Place the remaining pastry dough in the center of the circle and dust a little flour on top. Using the circle as a guide roll out the dough into a 12-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over a 9-inch pie dish and carefully unroll the dough to cover the top. Trim the top crust flush with the rim and decoratively crimp the edges.  In a small bowl beat the egg yolk with the milk to create an egg wash and use the pastry brush to lightly glaze the surface of the pie. Sprinkle the pie with 1 to 2 teaspoons of sugar. Use a paring knife to cut 3 or 4 decorative slits in the pie to allow steam to escape (or use a mini cookie cutter to make cuts in the dough). Bake the pie for 50 minutes to 60 minutes until the crust is a lovely golden brown and the apples are bubbling and tender when pierced with the top of a paring knife. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool for 40 to 60 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature with a scoop of ice cream.   Getting Ahead:  You can make the pie crust 2 days ahead and keep it chilled and covered. You can cut the toss the apples with lemon juice up to 2 days in advance (they will brown but they turn brown during baking anyway so do not worry).  The pie may be completely assembled and refrigerated for up to 1 hour before baking but if held longer the sugar melts into a syrup pools in the bottom of the pie shell and make the bottom crust soggy.  Storing: The pie will keep at room temperature under a cake dome for up to 2 days. For longer storage cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Reheat in a 375 degrees  F oven for 15 to 20 minutes to warm the filling and re-crisp the crust.

The pasta's name comes from the Italian verb 'pappare' which means "to gobble up." Here is a restaurant trick to make poached eggs in advance. Simply poach your eggs just until the whites are barely set and place directly into an ice bath to stop the cooking process. You can use the same bowl of ice water as the asparagus. When you're ready to use the eggs warm through in a simmering pot of water for about a minute and they're ready to serve. Eggs can be poached and chilled up to 2 days before serving.  In a steamer set over boiling water cover and steam asparagus until tender about 3 minutes. Transfer the asparagus to a colander drain and place in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Set aside.   To cook pasta: Heat a large pot of water over high heat until boiling. Generously season water with salt. Add pasta and stir immediately to prevent it from sticking together. Cook until al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve about a cup of pasta water and drain pasta through a colander.   To make sauce: Heat butter and cream in a skillet over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Stir in the lemon zest juice and salt. Add the hot pasta and asparagus to the sauce and cook gently tossing the pasta until coated with sauce. If the pasta looks dry add just enough of the reserved pasta water to achieve a saucy consistency. Add basil and parsley and toss through. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and generously season with black pepper.   To serve: Transfer pasta to 4 warmed pasta bowls and top each portion with a warmed poached egg and generously garnish with grated parmesan.

Grilled Swordfish with Peperonata,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/cuisine/bbq-recipes/Grilled Swordfish with Peperonata,4 servings,  Peperonata: 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  1/2 large red onion thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic minced 1 cup grated plum (Roma type) tomato 2 large bell peppers 1 red and 1 gold seeds removed and cut lengthwise into  3/4-inch-wide strips Kosher or sea salt Generous pinch of hot red pepper flakes 1 1/2 tablespoons capers preferably salt packed rinsed Red or white wine vinegar 12 fresh basil leaves plus more for optional garnish  4 swordfish steaks about 6 ounces each and  1/2 inch thick Extra virgin olive oil Kosher or sea salt 1 teaspoon fennel seed crushed in a mortar or spice grinder   , In Italy peperonata-braised peppers with tomato and onion-is typically served as an antipasto or side dish but it makes a superb fish topping. Substitute tuna halibut or cod for the swordfish if you prefer. Swordfish should be sliced thin and cooked quickly for maximum juiciness. If your merchant has already sliced it into thick steaks ask to have it halved horizontally or do it at home yourself with a long thin knife.  To make the peperonata heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over moderately low heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion is soft about 5 minutes. Add the tomato and simmer until it loses its raw taste about 5 minutes. Add the bell peppers and season with salt and hot pepper flakes. Cover and simmer gently until the peppers are tender about 25 minutes. Add a tablespoon or two of water if the mixture looks dry or uncover the skillet at the end of cooking to evaporate moisture if the mixture is too juicy. The juices should be concentrated not runny. Stir in the capers and a splash of vinegar to brighten the flavor then taste for salt. Set aside to cool until just warm not hot. Stir in the basil torn into smaller pieces.  While the peperonata is cooking prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium (375 degrees F). When the peperonata has been set aside to cool brush the fish generously on both sides with olive oil then season on both sides with salt and fennel seed. Grill directly over the coals or gas flame turning once until the fish is white throughout but still juicy 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Transfer the swordfish to a serving platter. Top each steak with some of the warm peperonata mounding it attractively. Garnish with more basil torn into smaller pieces. Serve immediately.   
Simple Beef Jerky,Maddy Ross Web Editor for Sur La Table,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Simple Beef Jerky,1 serving,  2 pounds lean flank steak 1 (8-ounce) jar coconut aminos 2 cloves garlic sliced Salt to taste   , Coconut Aminos are a great soy-free alternative to marinade-giving this beef jerky a slightly sweet glaze. A touch of garlic and salt makes this a very simple recipe.   Slice the flank steak against the grain into thin slices; as thin as possible. The trick to thin crisp jerky is to freeze the meat for 1 to 2 hours before slicing.  In a mixing bowl combine Coconut Aminos sliced garlic and sliced flank steak. Mix well cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for 10 to 12 hours.   Preheat oven to 175 degrees F.  Place an oven-safe cooling rack on a sheet pan. Remove marinated steak slices from refrigerator and run them through your fingers to remove excess marinade and garlic slices. Lay steak slices flat on the cooling rack and sprinkle with salt to taste.   Place rack in oven and cook for 3 to 4 hours. Check the jerky every hour turning thicker pieces over so they dehydrate evenly. Jerky should be dark and crisp.   Dehydrated beef jerky will last a few weeks. For fresher jerky store in a sealed container in the fridge.

Pretzels with Sweet Honey Mustard Dressing,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Pretzels with Sweet Honey Mustard Dressing,14 pretzels,  1 cup whole milk warm  2- 3/4 teaspoons rapid-rise yeast 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 4 cups all-purpose flour more for dusting 1- 1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt  1/2 cup warm water 2 tablespoons canola oil more for coating 1 whole egg lightly beaten 2 teaspoons poppy seeds or other seeds for garnishing Sweet Honey Mustard Dressing (recipe follows)   Sweet Honey Mustard Dressing:  3/4 cup Dijon mustard  3/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons honey Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper   , Everyone loves pretzels! Season yours with sugar salt seeds nuts and more! Better yet the yeast dough can be adapted to make monkey bread rolls and loaves!  Preheat an oven rack at 425 degrees and position one oven rack on the top and another on the bottom of the oven.   Place the warm milk in a small bowl. Add the yeast and sugar and using a spoon stir to dissolve. Set the bowl aside for 5 minutes until the mixture looks foamy.   In a large bowl combine the flour and salt and use a whisk to blend. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture water and oil into the well. Using a wooden spoon stir together the flour mixture and the liquids until you get big shaggy clumps of dough that stick together.  Any extra shaggy bits can be thrown away as they will produce dry lumps in your finished product.  On a work surface sprinkle a little flour and place the dough clumps onto the surface. Dip your hands into the flour and start kneading the dough until it is smooth springy and no longer sticky. If the dough feels sticky add a little more flour to the work surface or your hands. It will take about 5 to 7 minutes to knead.   Using a clean large bowl rub a little oil around the inside of the bowl. Shape the dough into a ball and put into the bowl. Lightly coat the dough with oil and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Seat the bowl aside and let the dough rise for 45 minutes or until it has doubled in size.  Once the dough has risen punch down the dough then use a bench scrapper to cut the dough into 14 equal pieces. Place one piece of the dough onto a clean work surface. Using your palms roll the piece into 20-inch long rope. To shape the pretzel first form the pretzel into a U. Then fold over the right end of the U and press it onto the left side of the bottom of the U. Repeat with the left end of the U pressing it onto the right side. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces.  Evenly space 6 pretzels on rimmed baking sheet lined with a silpat. Using a silicone pastry brush lightly brush the pretzels with the beaten egg and then sprinkle them with poppy seeds. Set the pans aside and let the dough rise for 10 minutes.  Bake for 7 minutes. Using oven mitts rotate the pans between the oven racks. Bake for another 7 to 9 minutes until golden brown. While the pretzels are baking prepare the sweet honey mustard dressing.  To serve: When the pretzels have finished baking transfer the baking sheets to cooling racks and leave to cool slightly. Serve with Honey Mustard Dressing on the side.  Sweet Honey Mustard Dressing: This recipe is an example of an emulsified dressing. The mayonnaise within the recipe stabilizes the mustard and honey to produce a dressing which does not require any stirring after it has been combined together.   In a medium bowl combine the mustard mayonnaise and honey and whisk them together. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve as a dipping sauce in a ramekin or small bowl on the side.

Crispy Corn Pancakes,Jacques Pepin Poulets & Legumes,home/recipes/appetizers/hot/Crispy Corn Pancakes,about 16 (3-inch) pancakes,   2/3 cup all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1 large egg 2 ears corn husked and kernels cut off (about 2 cups) 1 cup chilled club soda  3/4 teaspoon salt  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  1/2 cup canola oil   , Serve these pancakes as an hors d'oeuvre or a first course or as an accompaniment to pork. It's important to use a nonstick pan and very hot oil for cooking them; canola oil can withstand high temperatures without burning. For best results the pan should be cleaned between each batch of pancakes. When you prepare the batter you add only half of the club soda at first to the flour and egg mixture to create a thick batter that you make very smooth with a whisk before adding the remainder of the club soda. If you put it in all at once the flour would form into little lumps and the batter would have to be strained.   Although the pancakes are best when made at the last moment they can be made ahead and reheated in a hot oven or under the broiler.  Excerpted from JACQUES PEPIN POULET & LEGUMES: My Favorite Chicken & Vegetable Recipes &#169; 2016 by Jacques Pepin. Reproduced by permission of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Rux Martin Books. All rights reserved.  Combine the flour baking powder egg corn kernels and half of the club soda in a food processor and process for 10 seconds. Add the remaining club soda the salt and pepper and process for a few seconds until well combined. Transfer to a bowl.   At cooking time heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet. When it is hot spoon 3 tablespoons of batter per pancake into the skillet making 4 pancakes. (To make the pancakes faster use two skillets.) Use a splatter-guard if you have one and cook the pancakes over high heat for 3 minutes then turn them and cook for 2 minutes on the other side or until crispy at the edges and brown. Transfer the pancakes to a wire rack (the rack allows air to circulate under them so they won't become soggy). Wipe out the skillet and repeat with the remaining oil and batter in batches. Serve.

Maple-Pecan Sticky Buns,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Maple-Pecan Sticky Buns,10 buns,  1 recipe  Rich Breakfast Dough »   Topping:  3/4 stick unsalted butter softened (65&deg; to 68&deg;F)  1/3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar  1/3 cup maple syrup 1 cup chopped pecans  Filling:  1/2 stick unsalted butter softened  1/3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon   , Sticky buns are a favorite throughout the country and each region seems to have its own variation. You'll like this one with the deep caramel-tinged flavor of real maple syrup paired with its finest dance partner&#45;pecans. Be sure to turn these out of their baking pan while they are still quite warm or the topping will stick to the pan and the dough to the topping. But if this does happen set the pan on a burner turned to medium and wearing an oven mitt rotate the pan for 20 to 30 seconds until the butter and sugar mixture is melted again. Turn out as directed.  Make the topping: Place the butter and brown sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer and blend on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and slightly lightened 2 to 3 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl though you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape down the bowl. With the mixer running on medium pour the maple syrup in a thin stream down the side of the bowl and blend until smooth and homogenous. Scrape the topping into the cake pan and spread evenly. Scatter the chopped pecans over the top. Set aside while you make the buns.  Roll the dough: Dust your work surface with flour. Turn the risen dough out of the tub and onto the flour. Press down firmly with your hands to expel as much of the gas as possible but don't knead the dough or the gluten will be too developed for the dough to roll easily. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Roll the dough into a 10- by 16-inch rectangle. Position the dough so that one of the long sides is parallel to the edge of your work surface. Brush any remaining flour from the surface and underside of the dough.  Make the filling: Place the butter brown sugar and cinnamon in the bowl of the stand mixer and blend on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and slightly lightened 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl. Use a silicone or rubber spatula to spread the filling over the dough leaving a 1-inch border along the long side opposite you.  Shape the buns: Beginning with the long edge closest to you roll the dough into a cylinder gently tucking and tightening as you roll. Wet your fingers and rub a thin film of water along the empty border. Finish rolling the dough onto the border. Roll the dough backwards so that the seam is facing upward and pinch all along it to seal the dough. Turn the seam side down and use a chef's knife to cut the roll into 10 equal pieces. Set each bun with a cut side up on your work surface and gently flatten it slightly with the palm of your hand. Place the buns into the prepared cake pan spacing them evenly.  Proof the dough (second rise): Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cotton towel and set aside to rise until the rolls have almost doubled in size 45 to 60 minutes (longer if the room is cold).  Bake the sticky buns: Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Bake the buns for 30 to 35 minutes until the buns are deep golden brown and the centers register 185&deg;F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer to a cooling rack for 5 minutes then turn the buns out of the pan. To do this run a thin knife or small spatula around the edge of the pan to loosen the buns. Place a large plate or rimmed baking sheet upside down on top of the cake pan. Wearing oven mitts hold the cake pan against the plate and invert it. The sticky buns will fall out of the pan onto the plate along with their syrup and nuts. Serve the sticky buns warm or room temperature.  Storing: The sticky buns are at their best the same day they are made but will keep covered with a cake dome at room temperature for 2 days. For longer storage cover and refrigerate for up to 4 days. Reheat in a 350&deg;F oven for 7 to 10 minutes until warmed through.

Stir Fried Bok Choy with Shrimp and Oyster Sauce,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Stir Fried Bok Choy with Shrimp and Oyster Sauce,1 serving,  1 pound bok choy 2 tablespoons chicken broth 1 tablespoon oyster sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 1 teaspoon Chinese rice wine or dry sherry 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon peanut oil  1/2 pound medium shrimp (21 to 25 count) peeled deveined and patted dry Kosher or sea salt 2 slices fresh ginger 1⁄4 inch thick peeled and smacked with a cleaver or the side of a chef's knife 1 large clove garlic sliced  1/2 fresh red chile sliced (optional)   , This preparation works well with medium to large bok choy the type with broad white ribs and dark green leaves. But you can use the recipe as a template for stirfrying other green vegetables such as broccoli asparagus or mustard greens. The key to stir-frying vegetables successfully is to dry them thoroughly after washing so they sear rather than steam in the wok. The dish will serve two as a one-pot meal or four with other dishes.  Separate the bok choy leaves from the white ribs. Tear each leaf into 2 or 3 pieces. Halve the ribs lengthwise then cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces.  In a small bowl whisk together the broth oyster sauce soy sauce cornstarch sesame oil and rice wine.  Heat a large wok over high heat until a drop of water sizzles on contact. Add 1 teaspoon of the peanut oil and spread the oil around the bottom of the wok with a spatula. Add the shrimp season with salt and stir-fry until they turn pink but are not completely cooked through 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon peanut oil to the wok and spread the oil with the spatula. Add the ginger and cook for about 30 seconds to release its fragrance then add the bok choy stems garlic and chile. Stir-fry adjusting the heat to prevent scorching until the bok choy begins to soften 2 to 3  minutes. If the stems are quite thick you may need to add a tablespoon or two of water and cover the wok briefly to complete the cooking but do not overcook; the stems should remain firm to the tooth.  Stir the oyster sauce mixture to recombine and add to the wok along with the bok choy leaves. Stir-fry until the leaves begin to wilt less than a minute then add the shrimp and stir-fry until they are fully cooked. Transfer to a warmed platter and serve immediately.

Homemade Pumpkin Pie,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Homemade Pumpkin Pie,1 (10-inch) regular pie or 1 (9-inch) deep-dish pie,  1 recipe Perfect Pie Crust  3 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon ground ginger  3/4 teaspoon grated whole nutmeg (about 20 grates on a whole nutmeg)   3/4 teaspoon ground cloves  3/4 teaspoon ground allspice  1/8 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) heavy whipping cream  1/2 cup (4 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar 2 cups (16 ounces) canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)  Whipped cream for serving   ,  Thanksgiving just may be everyone's favorite holiday. After all what's better than a day completely devoted to a delicious feast shared by family and friends all giving thanks for their blessings? This recipe takes an American classic to celebration status with a careful blend of spices and heavy cream outshining the stale spice mix and evaporated milk of less enchanting recipes. Ever notice how spices clump up and don't blend well when added to a custard? The trick is to blend them first with the eggs whose fat helps the clumps disperse evenly before adding any liquid to the custard mixture.  To prepare the pie crust remove the dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll chilled dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until the circle measures 14 inches wide and  1/8 inch thick. Starting at one edge roll the dough around the rolling pin and lay it gently on top of a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie pan. Gently press the dough into the bottom and sides of the pan. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough so it overhangs the edge of the pan by 1 inch. Fold the overhanging dough under itself around the pan edge then crimp or form a decorative border. Chill the lined pan for at least 30 minutes.   Preheat oven to 375 degrees and place a rack in the bottom third. Line the chilled pie shell with heavy-duty foil pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 20 to 22 minutes until the foil comes away from the dough easily (if it doesn't then bake another 5 to 6 minutes and check again). Remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and lift out the foil and weights from the shell; set them aside to cool. Return the pan to the oven to continue baking the shell for about 10 minutes then remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and check to see if any cracks have formed. If you see a crack very gently smear a tiny bit of reserved dough over the crack to patch it-you need only enough to seal the opening. Return the pan to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer until the crust is a nice golden brown all over. Transfer to a rack and cool slightly. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.  While the pie crust is baking make the filling. Whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl to break them up. Add cinnamon ginger nutmeg cloves allspice and salt and whisk well to blend evenly. Whisk in the cream brown sugar granulated sugar and pumpkin and blend well. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer directly into the tart shell and bake until the custard is set about 30 to 40 minutes. Test by tapping the side of the pie pan-the center of the pie should look firm and move as one piece. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool completely about 2 hours.  To serve slice the pie with a thin and sharp knife and use a pie server to transfer each slice to a plate. Serve with whipped cream.

Add steak and mix to coat. Cover and let steak marinate for 20 to 30 minutes.  With the remaining 2 tablespoons oil brush a large grill pan and heat on high heat. Add the onion rings and grill until charred and softened. Next do the same with the bell pepper quarters poblano quarters and scallions. Transfer cooked vegetables to a cutting board and tent with foil.  Brush the grill pan with oil and heat over high. Add the steak and sear on one side for 3-5 minutes until a good char is achieved flip and grill on the other side. Cook until an instant read thermometer reads 140 degrees F when inserted into the middle of the steak. Remove from pan and tent.  While steak is cooking cut the onion rings in half and transfer to a large warm platter along with the grilled scallions cut the bell pepper and poblano quarters into strips and transfer to the platter with the onions. Thinly slice the steak and arrange on the platter alongside the vegetables. Serve with toasted or warmed tortillas salsa cheese and sour cream.  For the tortillas: Place masa and salt in a bowl and thoroughly combine with the fat mixing with fingers or a whisk. Slowly stream in the water while mixing with your hands or a wooden spoon until the dough comes together into a ball. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth about 1 minute. Divide the dough into 12 1-ounce portions and form each into a smooth ball. Place masa balls on a baking sheet cover with plastic and rest for 30 minutes.   After the dough has rested preheat a cast iron skillet over medium-high for 5 minutes and then reduce heat to medium.  If the dough has dried slightly during resting wet hands and roll each ball again to moisten. Place the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and place directly in the center of the tortilla press. Press down firmly then turn the tortilla 90 degrees and press again repeating 1 to 2 more times or until the tortilla is evenly  1/8 inch thick.  If the raw tortilla cracks or breaks don’t worry: just grab another piece of dough and start again. Holding the tortilla flat in your palm carefully peel the plastic away and transfer it into the hot skillet. Cook the tortilla until brown spots appear on the bottom about 1 minute. Flip with a thin metal spatula and do the same on the other side. Transfer tortilla to a baking sheet and cover with a damp towel to trap in the heat and moisture. Reuse the plastic for your next tortilla; it will become more pliable with every pressing. Once you get the hang of it transfer the pressed tortilla straight into the hot skillet and start pressing the next one while the first is cooking.  When ready to serve reheat the tortillas wrapped in foil in a 350 degrees F oven for 10 minutes. You can store the tortillas tightly wrapped in plastic in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

Iced Honey-Apple Scones with Spelt,Dorie Greenspan,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Iced Honey-Apple Scones with Spelt,12 snowball-shaped or 8 wedge-shaped scones,  2 cups (272 grams) all-purpose flour ½ cup (75 grams) spelt flour 1 tablespoon baking powder ¼ teaspoon baking soda ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt 1 small tangerine 1 clementine or ½ orange ¾ stick (6 tablespoons; 3 ounces; 85 grams) cold unsalted butter cut into small chunks 1 medium apple peeled cored and finely chopped ¼ cup (60 ml) honey 1 cold large egg ¾ cup (180 ml) cold milk  For the icing ½ cup (60 grams) confectioners’ sugar About 1 tablespoon milk About 1 teaspoon bee pollen for finishing (see headnote; optional)    , These are the scones to make the instant you feel fall in the air. They’ve got apples honey and tangerine flavors of the season and the surprise addition of some spelt a wheat flour that speckles their interiors. Their texture is light and because they are only slightly sweet they can take a slick of icing. My choice is a simple confectioners’ sugar icing brushed on when the scones come out of the oven. While the icing is still wet I sometimes sprinkle the tops with a few grains of bee pollen. The pollen is optional but its light sweetness and chewiness finish the scones nicely.  The dough for these is very sticky so sticky that you might want to make drop scones rather than patty-cake the dough it into a disk and cut wedges. It’s a good option. Whatever you do don’t decide that the dough needs more flour—it doesn’t! All that stickiness bakes to a light airy crumb.  A word on working ahead: The dough can be made cut and frozen up to 2 months ahead—make sure to wrap the scones airtight—and then baked straight from the freezer. As soon as you start to preheat the oven place the scones on a lined baking sheet and let them stand until the oven reaches temperature. You may need to bake them a few minutes longer.  Center a rack in the oven and preheat it to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat.  Working in a large bowl whisk together both flours the baking powder baking soda and salt. Finely grate the zest of the tangerine clementine or orange into the bowl and whisk it in—hold onto the fruit. Scatter the bits of cold butter over the flour reach in and use your fingers to mash and press and mush the butter into the flour. (You can do this with a pastry cutter but it’s really easier and faster to use your fingers.) Keep tossing the dry ingredients around and smushing the butter until you’ve broken it into flour-coated pieces as small as cornflakes and as big as peas. Add the apple to the bowl and toss until covered in flour. Pour over the honey and using a fork give the mixture a couple of turns. There’s no need to be thorough now.   Whisk the egg and milk together in a small bowl squeeze in the juice from the zested citrus and stir to blend. Pour the mixture over the dry ingredients and using the fork toss turn and stir everything together until the flour is moistened. With your hands gently—and sparingly—squeeze and knead the dough just enough to pull it into a ball. It’s futile (and unnecessary) to expect a smooth neat packet of dough because this dough is wet and very sticky.  Now you’ve got a choice: If you want to make drop scones choose an ice cream scoop—one with a capacity of ¼ cup is good as is a ¼-cup measure or a large spoon—and scoop 12 portions of dough onto the baking sheet. If you want to make wedge shaped scones turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle that’s about 6½ inches across and 1 inch high (the height’s more important than the diameter here). Dust the top with flour. Using a bench scraper or a chef’s knife cut the dough into quarters and then cut each quarter in half so you have 8 wedges. Carefully transfer them to the baking sheet. (At this point the scones can be froze for up to 2 months; see headnote.)  Bake the scones for 18 to 20 minutes or until they’re tall and golden brown on top and bottom. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack and make the icing.  To make the icing: Put the sugar in a medium bowl and add the milk a little at a time stirring with a small flexible spatula or a spoon. It’s hard to give a precise measurement for the milk—just keep stirring until you get a shiny icing that falls slowly from the tip of your spatula or spoon.  Spread some icing over each scone using a silicone brush a small offset spatula or a table knife. If you’d like s 
Turkey Pozole Verde,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/soups-stews/meat-poultry/Turkey Pozole Verde,ings,  6 cups turkey or chicken broth low sodium divided 1 pound tomatillos husked and halved 1 small yellow onion thinly sliced 2 poblano chiles cored seeded and quartered 2 green jalape&#241;o chiles with seeds stems removed 2 medium garlic cloves peeled 1/2 cup chopped cilantro Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 (29 ounce) can hominy drained and rinsed 3 cups shredded cooked turkey meat    Condiments  2 medium limes cut into wedges  1/4 cup sour cream 2 cups shredded radish   , This hearty soup is actually more of a stew and is absolutely ideal for using Thanksgiving leftovers.

Peanut Butter–Banana Cookies,Aran Goyoaga,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Peanut Butter–Banana Cookies,14 COOKIES,   1/2 cup (75 g) salted roasted peanuts 2 tablespoons sugar (optional)  1 cup (240 g) unsweetened chunky peanut butter 2/3 cup (120 g) coconut sugar   3/4 cup finely mashed banana (about 1 medium)  2 tablespoons maple syrup 2 teaspoons vanilla extract  1/2 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt   , You would never know how decadent these cookies are by looking at the ingredient list. Because they are vegan and free of gluten and refined sugar I feel good making these often for a nourishing snack. The coconut sugar perfectly complements the peanut and banana here. I have made several versions of these cookies with only maple syrup but the crisp factor is not there when the coconut sugar is left out.  1.    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.   2.    Coarsely chop the peanuts. Reserve half of them and continue chopping the remaining half into very small pieces. Put the finely chopped peanuts in a small bowl add the sugar and set aside. The sugar adds a bit of crunch to the exterior of the cookie but it's not essential.  3.    Stir together the reserved coarsely chopped peanuts peanut butter coconut sugar banana maple syrup vanilla baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. The dough will be thick and sticky. Let it sit for 15 minutes. As the baking soda reacts the dough will thicken a bit.   4.    Scoop 1 heaping tablespoon of dough into the bowl of finely chopped peanuts. Roll the dough around to coat then roll it into a ball in your hands. Place on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough. Leave 2 inches between cookies as they will spread while baking. Flatten them slightly with your fingers.  5.    Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until the cookies crack and their edges begin to look crispy. Do not overbake as they will continue to dry out while cooling. Cool on the pan for 10 minutes then transfer to a wire rack. The cookies will be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They will keep for 5 days in an airtight container.   ©2021 by Aran Goyoaga. Excerpted from Cannelle et Vanille Bakes Simple: A New Way to Bake Gluten-Free by permission of Sasquatch Books.

Cut the potatoes (leave skin on) into  3/4" thick waffles on a mandoline.  Cover these in cold water until ready to use.   First Frying: The first frying is basically to cook the potatoes through. If you've ever tried to make Pommes Frites by skipping this step you know the necessity of the first frying.   First heat the oil to 320 degrees F. Drain then thoroughly dry the potatoes with paper towels. Water will break down your frying oil (as will salt). Next when the oil is hot and the potatoes are dry drop them in batches (do not over crowd). Fry for about 4-5 minutes or until they're cooked through but NOT browned. Remove and place on a paper towel lined plate. Reserve the oil. You can prepare these a few hours ahead and leave them at room temperature.  Second Frying: Heat the oil to 365-375 degrees F. When you're ready to serve the potatoes drop them in batches as in the first frying. Fry until they're golden brown and crispy. Place finished potatoes onto a plate or baking sheet lined with dry paper towels and season liberally with salt. Serve immediately.

Chocolate and Salted-Caramel Cream Puffs,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Chocolate and Salted-Caramel Cream Puffs,20 cream puffs,   1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1/8 teaspoon salt  1/2 cup whole milk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 or 3 large whole eggs    4- 1/2 cups sugar 2/3 cup water 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter at room temperature 1- 1/2 cups cream cheese at room temperature cut into small pieces  1/2-cup heavy cream Icing sugar for dusting   , The two recipes below contain a variation from standard recipes. The profiterole recipe contains cocoa powder to produce a rich chocolate flavor. And instead of making a pastry cream we are using a cream-cheese base to make a salted-caramel cream.    Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F.   To make the profiteroles: In a small bowl sift the flour cocoa and 1/8 teaspoon salt. In a medium saucepan bring milk butter and granulated sugar to a boil stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the flour mixture using a wooden spoon. Return the saucepan to a medium heat; cook stirring constantly until the dough forms and the mixture is pulling away from the sides of the saucepan about 2- 1/2 minutes.   Transfer the dough to a bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium speed until slightly cooled about 2 minutes. Beat in 2 eggs 1 at a time. Test dough by touching it with your finger and lifting to form a string. If the string does not form the batter needs more eggs. In a small bowl lightly beat remaining egg and add to dough 1 teaspoon at a time testing after each addition. Beat until batter is smooth and glossy about 2 minutes.   Using a pastry bag fitted with a  1/2-inch round tip pipe about 20 1- 1/2-inch rounds of batter onto a parchment-lined baking sheet spacing about 1 inch apart. Bake until puffed and cooked through about 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool completely.  To make the salted-caramel cream: Put the sugar and 2/3 cup water in a heavy medium saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat stirring occasionally until the sugar has dissolved. Continue to cook without stirring until the syrup comes to a boil washing down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent crystals from forming. Let boil swirling the pan occasionally until the mixture turns a medium amber color. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly until warm.   In a stand mixer whisk together the butter and cream cheese. When mixture is well combined add the cream. Continue to beat until thoroughly mixed and smooth. Add the caramel and mix until well combined. If you are not using immediately transfer to an airtight container. When ready to use beat mixture with a whisk until thick enough to hold a ribbon on the surface before using; add more cream should the mixture become too thick.  To assemble: Place the salted-caramel cream into a piping bag fitted with a  1/2-inch round piping tip. Cut the profiteroles in half and pipe the salted-caramel cream onto the bottom layer of the profiterole and then place the top layer of the profiterole on the top. Arrange the filled profiteroles onto a platter sprinkle with icing sugar and serve.

To make the pesto: Put the almonds parmesan cheese and the olive oil in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to achieve a pasty texture.  Add the thyme leaves parsley and garlic and process to a smooth consistency. You may need to add a little extra olive oil if the pesto is too stiff.

Gateau de Hannouka,Joan Nathan Quiches Kugels and Couscous,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Gateau de Hannouka,8 to 10 servings,  1 cup vegetable oil plus more for greasing pan 5 apples (3 Fuji and 2 Granny Smith or any combination of sweet and tart apples) peeled cored and cut into  1/2-inch pieces (about 6 cups) Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon  1/3 cup walnut halves roughly chopped 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder  1/8 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons chopped almonds 1 3/4 cups and 2 tablespoons sugar 4 large eggs  3/4 teaspoon almond extract   , Danielle Fleischmann bakes this apple cake in the same beat-up rectangular pan that her mother used. Known as a "Jewish Apple Cake" because oil is substituted for butter it is called G&#226;teau de Hannouka in France.   When Danielle makes the cake she uses very little batter and half sweet and half tart apples a combination that makes a really tasty version of this simple Polish cake. Although her mother grated the apples Danielle cuts them into small chunks. I often make it in a Bundt pan and serve it sprinkled with sugar.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease a Bundt pan or a 9" x 13" baking pan.  Toss the apples in a large bowl with the zest and juice of the lemon walnuts and cinnamon.  Pulse together the flour baking powder salt almonds and 1 3/4 cups of sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. With the food processor running add the eggs oil and almond extract processing until just mixed.  Spoon  1/3 of the batter over the bottom of the pan. Scatter the apples on top and cover the apples with the remaining batter. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar (you'll need less if using a Bundt pan).  Bake for 45-60 minutes or until golden and cooked through. The cake will take a shorter time to bake in the shallow rectangular pan than in the Bundt pan.   
Sous Vide Flavor-Packed Pickles,ChefSteps,home/recipes/appetizers/cold/Sous Vide Flavor-Packed Pickles,1 serving,  Fruits or vegetables any as needed Brine see options below as needed Seasonings any as needed  Savory Pickling Brine: 400g Vinegar white wine 400g Water 80g Sugar granulated 20g Salt  Sweet Pickling Brine: 400g Vinegar white wine 400g Water 265g Sugar granulated   , This recipe was designed for use with the Joule Sous Vide by Chef Steps.  Set water to 140 degrees F / 60 degrees C  Inspect and clean your jars: As any canner worth his handmade raspberry preserves will tell you it's important to inspect your jars before you go a-pickling. If you see any of the following issues you need new jars: cracks or chips in the glass bent or warped lids food residue or anything else on the lids-you want those clean chipped or banged-up rubber on the lid  Pick your brine: Broadly speaking you want to use a savory brine for vegetables and a sweet one for fruit.  Prep ingredients: Peel or chop away rinds stems or any other parts of the future pickles that you don't want to eat. Rinse fresh herbs.   Put it all in a jar: Transfer fruits and veggies along with any seasonings to your jars taking care not to overfill them. The food and seasonings should be able to float around freely. Food should reach no higher than about 0.75 in (2 cm) below the lid. Add brine stopping when the liquid level is about half an inch (1 cm) from the top of the jar.  Close jars until "fingertip tight": Place the lid on the jar. Twist the lid until "fingertip tight" meaning just barely closed and still possible to open with your fingertips. To close the jars fingertip tight place the lid on top of the jar then twist the band to tighten using just your fingertips. When you begin to feel resistance twist once in the opposite direction then once more in the original direction to tighten. Closing the jars until fingertip tight means that air will be able to escape from the jars when you submerge them in water. If you close them too tightly the trapped air will press against the glass and could crack or break your jars.  Cook for 2 1/2 hours: Lower jars into the heated water carefully. Walk away! Joule will watch over your fruits and veggies so you can go pickle your liver at the bar while they pasteurize.  Rest at room temp: After two and a half hours remove your pickles from the water and allow them to rest overnight on the counter. CAUTION: Do not submerge the jars in ice water for rapid chilling-they may well shatter if you do.  Pucker up!: You can now start chomping on yo' pickles or store them in a clean cool dark place for up to six months.

Risotto alla Parmigiana con Salamino - Risotto Parmigiana Style with Italian Sausage,Academia Barilla adapted by the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Risotto alla Parmigiana con Salamino - Risotto Parmigiana Style with Italian Sausage,5 servings,  3 tablespoons butter 1 medium onion small dice 2 cups Carnaroli rice 6 oz Academia Barilla Salame Di Parma small dice  3/4 cup white wine 6 cups chicken or beef broth 3 oz Academia Barilla Parmigiano-Reggiano Salt and pepper to taste   , Carnaroli rice is rich in soluble starch. It is considered the best rice for risotto because of the consistency of the grains its high starch content and resistance to quick cooking.  Adding the rice to the saucepan on the heat without any liquid is an important step because it can determine the final texture of the risotto. Toasting the rice quickly heats up the grain's exterior which prevents it from breaking and seals in the starch. The rice should remain pearly white in color and not turn brown during toasting.  It is essential to use a wooden spoon while stirring risotto; a metal spoon is more likely to damage the grains of rice.  Bring broth to simmer in large saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to low; cover to keep warm.  In a heavy bottom pan melt the 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add onions and saute until tender about 6 minutes. Add rice and sausage; stir about 1-2 minutes. Add wine and stir until evaporated about 1 minute. Add 1 1/2 cups hot broth; simmer until absorbed stirring frequently. Add remaining broth  1/2 cup at a time allowing broth to be absorbed before adding more and stirring frequently until rice is creamy and al dente about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in cheese along with remaining butter. Season risotto with salt and pepper. Transfer to single serve bowls and serve.

Smoky Tomato Ketchup,Sur La Table Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/appetizers/dips-spreads-sauces-seasonings/Smoky Tomato Ketchup,3 (8-ounce) bottles of ketchup,  2 tablespoons pulverized apple wood smoking chips 1 medium yellow onion cut into  1/2-inch-thick rounds 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes including the juice from the can 1 tablespoon capers drained and rinsed  1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar Juice of 1 orange strained Juice of  1/2 grapefruit strained Juice of  1/2 lemon strained  3/4 cup cider vinegar 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher or sea salt  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   , It's hard to believe I would make my own ketchup to give as gifts considering that I grew up in Pittsburgh PA-home of Heinz and the big "Heinz 57" sign boldly lit and dominant on the skyline. It never even occurred to me that ketchup could be homemade until I ate at Paley's Place Bistro and Bar in Portland Oregon and had chef Vitaly Paley's deliciously nuanced ketchup. He makes all his condiments from scratch including his ketchup and I was inspired to make my own. I wanted the bright fresh flavors of Vitaly's ketchup but with a smoky twist so with his advice I smoked the onions before stewing them with the tomatoes. Given in old-fashioned hinge-topped clear glass bottles these make an adorable summertime present for the host of a backyard barbecue or as part of a Father's Day gift.  Using a stovetop smoker or wok place the wood chips in two small piles in the center of the pan. If using a smoker place a drip tray covered with aluminum foil on top of the chips. If using a wok set a large sheet of aluminum foil loosely in place over the wood chips. Place a wire rack on top of the drip tray or foil. Arrange the onion slices on the wire rack. Slide the lid on the stovetop smoker or cover the wok leaving it slightly open and then place the smoker over medium heat. When the first wisp of smoke appears close the lid. Smoke the onions for 5 minutes then turn off the heat and leave the onions in the smoker or wok with the lid tightly closed for an additional 5 minutes. Remove the onions from the smoker and coarsely chop.  Puree the tomatoes in a blender on high speed until liquefied about 2 minutes. Transfer the tomatoes to a deep 6-quart saucepan or Dutch oven and reserve.  Puree the onions and capers in the blender on high speed for 1 minute. Add the sugar and continue blending on high speed until the onion mixture is smooth about 1 minute longer. Add the citrus juices vinegar salt and pepper and blend to incorporate. Transfer the onion mixture to the pot with the tomatoes and stir to combine.  Over medium heat bring the tomato and onion mixture to a simmer. Decrease the heat to maintain a low simmer and cook stirring occasionally until the sauce thickens to a ketchup consistency 50 minutes to 1 hour.  While the ketchup is simmering wash the bottles in hot soapy water and dry thoroughly. Alternatively run the bottles through the regular cycle of your dishwasher.  Using a funnel ladle the ketchup into the prepared bottles leaving  1/2-inch headspace. Wipe the rims clean and secure the lids. Label and refrigerate.  Storing: Refrigerate for up to 2 months.

Flourless Chocolate Almond Cake,Southern Italian Desserts,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Flourless Chocolate Almond Cake,12 servings,  8 ounces (226 g) dark chocolate (55 to 60 percent cacao)  1 2/3 cups (250 g) skin-on almonds 1 cup (226 g) unsalted butter softened 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar 5 large eggs separated 2 tablespoons coffee liqueur such as Kahlua (optional)  Pinch of kosher salt Confectioners' sugar or whipped cream for serving   , This rich cake takes its name from the island of Capri where it originated. Many tales are told of the way the cake came about perhaps the most charming of which recounts a visit to Capri in the 1920s from a group of Mafia men on behalf of Al Capone. Pastry chef Carmine Di Fiore was mortified when he realized he'd forgotten the flour in the cake but the mobsters liked the moist chocolaty confection so much they asked for its name. Di Fiore quickly replied "Torta Caprese!" and it has kept that name ever since. The cake is renowned on the island and throughout the Amalfi Coast.  Pastry shops and home bakers often add a hint of liqueur which is entirety optional; I like it with Kahlua but Strega is more common on the Amalfi Coast.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (163 degrees C) with a rack in the center. Butter a 10-inch springform pan.  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or in a bowl placed over but not touching about an inch of simmering water. Set aside until cool. Process the almonds in a food processor until they have the texture of coarse cornmeal stopping before they are as fine as flour.  Mix the butter with about half of the sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment at medium speed until smooth scraping the bowl as needed. Add the yolks one at a time beating and scraping the bowl between additions. At low speed mix in the liqueur if using and the melted chocolate until well blended then mix in the ground almonds. (Alternatively use a handheld electric mixer.)  Beat the egg whites and salt in a clean bowl using a clean whisk attachment at medium speed until they form soft peaks. Gradually add the remaining  1/2 cup sugar a little at a time then continue to beat at high speed until firm peaks form that are not at all dry.  Using a large spatula fold one-third of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it then gently fold in the remaining whites until no streaks remain. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs clinging to it 50 to 55 minutes. Set the pan on a wire rack to cool. Once cool run a knife around the edge of the cake then release and remove the ring. Transfer the cake on the pan bottom to a serving plate as I prefer or invert onto the serving plate as they do in Capri.  To serve dust the top of the cake with confectioners' sugar or top with a dollop of whipped cream.

Stir to make sure fruit is covered in vodka. Cover and chill. Bachelor jam will be ready to drink after a few days and can be stored for up to 1 year if covered in vodka. Throughout the season continue to add fruit and sugar (ratio of about 1 lb. fruit to 1 cup sugar) and enough vodka to cover.   To serve: Strain and serve over ice with a splash of soda water. Garnish with a few pieces of fruit from the jar if you like.  Notes:Similar to the German drink rumtopf Bachelor Jam is not a breakfast spread but an old-fashioned drink made with fruit alcohol and sugar. It's one of the oldest forms of fruit  preservation. The concoction is usually made in the summer with the holidays in mind as it gets better with age.  Makes a delicious addition to sangria but watch out it's boozy!  The fruit itself can be spooned over pound cake ice cream or stirred into your drink.   Swap the vodka for brandy or gin.

Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/breakfast/egg-dishes/Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise,4 servings,  For the benedict: 8 large eggs 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar 4 English muffins split 16 slices smoked salmon 2 tablespoons minced chives  For the Hollandaise sauce:    1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter  3 large egg yolks 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice plus more to taste Pinch of cayenne Sea salt   , Here is a restaurant trick to make poached eggs in advance. Simply poach your eggs just until the whites are barely set and place directly into an ice bath to stop the cooking process. When you're ready to use the eggs warm them though in a simmering pot of water for about a minute and they’re ready to serve.  Eggs can be poached and chilled up to 2 days before serving.  For the benedict: Fill a medium bowl halfway with warm water. Fill a 4 quart saucepan halfway with water stir in white vinegar and bring to a gentle simmer. Break each egg into a small dish. Slide one egg into saucepan and immediately push the white around the yolk with a slotted spoon to form an oval shape. Poach egg for 2 minutes for runny yolks or 3 to 4 minutes for firm yolks. Immediately transfer poached egg to bowl with warm water. Repeat with remaining eggs. (Multiple eggs can be poached at the same time however for more perfect eggs poaching 1 to 2 eggs at a time is recommended.) To serve lift eggs from the warm water with a slotted spoon one egg at a time and dab the back of the spoon onto a double layer of paper towels to drain off the excess water trim any rough edges if desired.  To prepare Hollandaise sauce: Melt the butter in a small saucepan until very hot. Combine the egg yolks lemon juice and cayenne in the base of a blender. Blend the egg yolk mixture until it lightens in color about 30 seconds. With the blender running slowly pour in the hot butter until the sauce is creamy. If the sauce is too thick thin with a little water or additional lemon juice. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt.  To assemble benedict: Split the English muffins and divide between 4 plates top each English muffin with 2 slices smoked salmon and then a poached egg spoon hollandaise over each egg and garnish with minced chives.

Salmon Gravlax,Gifts Cooks Love: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Diane Morgan photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/appetizers/cold/Salmon Gravlax,1 (3- to 4-pound) fillet of gravlax; once sliced it can be portioned into 6 appetizers,   1/2 cup coarse sea salt or kosher salt  1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 salmon fillet (3 to 4 pounds) skin on and scaled pin bones removed 10 sprigs dill coarsely chopped  3/4 cup gin   , One of the most delicate and least embellished salmon preparations is gravlax a Scandinavian specialty in which the fish is cured by means of a salt and sugar rub. No cooking is involved. We like to think of this paper-thin sliced raw fish as one step beyond Japanese sashimi. Typically gravlax is seasoned with fresh dill a brandy such as Cognac and spruce sprigs. Not everyone has a spruce tree growing in the yard so we've decided to re-create that woodsy flavor by including gin in our recipe. The gin's mild juniper berry flavor is a lovely accent with the dill.  Select a 2-inch-deep glass or ceramic baking dish that fits the length of the fish as closely as possible. In a small bowl combine the salt and sugar and spread half of this mixture on the bottom of the baking dish. Lay the salmon skin side down in the dish. Gently rub the remaining salt mixture over the flesh side of the fillet. Spread the dill over the fillet. Slowly drizzle the gin over the fish being careful not to rinse off the salt cure.  Place a large sheet of plastic wrap directly on top of the fish. Select a slightly smaller baking dish or some other large flat object to rest on top of the fish. Place something that weighs several pounds in the top of the dish. I use full beer bottles set on their sides.  Place the weighted salmon in the refrigerator for at least 2 days or up to 5 days. Turn the salmon over once a day being sure to weight the salmon after each turn.  Once cured skin the fillet and then cut the fillet into  3/4-inch-thick crosswise slices. Arrange on a plate wooden board or in packages ready for gift giving. Cover tightly and refrigerate.  Storing: Refrigerate covered for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months. (If freezing wrap the gravlax completely in plastic wrap and then in a double layer of aluminum foil.)   
Truffled Deviled Eggs,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/appetizers/cold/Truffled Deviled Eggs,24 servings,  12 large eggs  1/2 cup mayonnaise   1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons black truffle oil  2 teaspoon lemon juice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons finely chopped chives   , To hard boil the eggs: Fill a large saucepan with water and place on the stove over a medium-high heat to boil. Using a thumb tack poke a hole in the thick end of the egg. This will prevent the egg from floating and make it easier to peel later. Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water and place a lid over the top. Using a kitchen timer cook the eggs for exactly 10 minutes and then transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water. Let the eggs cool completely about 30 minutes and then peel the outer shell.  To prepare the deviled eggs: Cut the peeled eggs in half lengthwise and use a small teaspoon to remove the yolks placing them into a medium bowl. Place the hollowed egg whites aside on a plate or baking sheet.   Add the mayonnaise mustard oil and lemon juice to the yolks. Mash well with a fork until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   Transfer the yolk mixture into a piping bag with a smooth tip and pipe the mixture into the cavity of the egg whites. Garnish with the chives; chill until ready to serve.

Total cook time is 2.5 hours but you have to cool the pie to add the gelatin and then you have cool the pie in the fridge once completed overnight. Prep time for the pork mixture is approximately 20-30 minutes pastry is 15-20 minutes and gelatin is 15 minutes.  Make the Filling: In a large mixing bowl add all three pork components thyme sage nutmeg mace salt and pepper and blend thoroughly with a wooden spoon (or your hands.) Refrigerate until it's time to add to the pan.  Make the Pastry: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Add flour to a large mixing bowl.

Remove  3/4 of the dough for the top wrap with plastic and set aside.  Use the remaining  3/4 to line evenly along the sides and bottom of a springform pan. We used one that was 7 inches lightly buttered.  Add pork mixture and pack rather tightly.  Roll out the dough reserved for the top to about a 5 mm thickness. Stretch it enough to pinch together with the sides already in the pan then place on top of the meat.  Now cut away a hole or vent for steam. This is also where you will pour the gelatin.  Place in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F.  After 30 minutes reduce the heat to 325 degrees F and bake for 90 minutes.  At 90 minutes brush the top with beaten egg and place back in the over for another 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool at room temperature for roughly an hour and a half.

Make the Gelatin: Combine the gelatin with 1 cup cold chicken stock and wait 5 to 10 minutes until you can see that it's worked its magic  Heat the remaining chicken stock to almost a boil remove from heat and stir in the gelatin. Set aside and allow cool at room temperature.  When the pie has cooled use a funnel (a turkey baster also works) to add the gelatin in batches into the steam vent.  Cover the pie with plastic and place in the refrigerator overnight.

Cedar-Plank Salmon with Wasabi-Lime Aioli,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Cedar-Plank Salmon with Wasabi-Lime Aioli,4 servings,  2 cedar planks  1 large egg yolk 1 small clove garlic peeled and finely minced 1 tablespoon lime juice plus more as needed 1 teaspoon wasabi powder 1 teaspoon water  3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil  3/4 cup canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (5-ounce) salmon fillets skin-on and pin-bones removed 1 tablespoon canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper   , Cedar wood imparts the salmon with a lush and smoky aromatic flavor. When cooking with planks they need to be immersed in water at least an hour prior to grilling as the water produces a maximum smoke flavor and makes the plank more resistant to charring on the grill.  Fully submerge cedar planks in cold water at least one hour prior to cooking.  To make the wasabi-lime aioli: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade add the egg yolk garlic lime juice wasabi powder and water and mix until combined. While processing add in oils in a thin stream until a thick sauce forms. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt pepper and lime juice. Cover and keep refrigerated until ready to use.  Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium. Close the grill lid and preheat to around 375 degrees F. Alternatively preheat an oven to 375 degrees F and place a rack in the center.  Remove the soaked cedar plank from the water and place on a grill rack. Close the grill and allow the board to heat for a few minutes until it begins to smoke and crackle. If using a plank for the first time season the plank by placing it on a preheated grill for 2 minutes turning once. Lightly toasting the plank on both sides will intensify its smoky flavor and prevent warping. When the plank starts crackling it's ready for cooking.  Use a silicone brush to coat the salmon with oil and season with salt and pepper. Using tongs arrange the salmon evenly on the cedar plank. Cover the grill or close the oven and cook until flaky about 8 to 10 minutes for 1-inch thick filets. Transfer salmon to warmed dinner plate top with a dollop of aioli and serve.

Leaf-Crust Pumpkin Pie,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Leaf-Crust Pumpkin Pie,1 (9-inch) pie,  Pie Crust: makes 2 (9-inch) pie shells 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 10 tablespoons (1- 3/4 sticks) cold unsalted butter cut into tablespoons 6 ounces cream cheese (not low-fat) at room temperature cut into  3/4-inch pieces  Filling: makes 1 (9-inch) pie 3 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon ground ginger  3/4 teaspoon nutmeg (about 20 grates on a whole nutmeg)  3/4 teaspoon ground cloves  3/4 teaspoon ground allspice  1/8 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) heavy whipping cream  1/2 cup (4 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar  3/4 cup (1- 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar 2 cups (16 ounces) canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling) Whipped cream for serving   , This recipe takes an American classic to celebration status with a careful blend of spices and heavy cream outshining the stale spice mix and evaporated milk of less enchanting recipes. Ever notice how spices clump up and don't blend well when added to a custard? The trick is to blend them first with the eggs whose fat helps the clumps disperse evenly before adding any liquid to the custard mixture.  To make the dough: Put the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse briefly to combine. Scatter the butter and cream cheese over the top and pulse about  12 times or just enough until the dough begins to clump together (butter pieces will still be visible). Turn the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and gather it together.  Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled but not hard 1 to 2 hours.  Lightly flour a work surface and roll out a dough disc into a 12-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. The remaining pie dough can be left frozen for later use or rolled into a second 12-inch round for an additional pie. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over a 9-inch pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Trim the overhanging dough to  1/2 inch.   Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and place a rack in the bottom third.   Make the filling: Whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl to break them up. Add cinnamon ginger nutmeg cloves allspice and salt and whisk well to blend evenly. Whisk in the cream brown sugar granulated sugar and pumpkin and blend well.   Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer directly into the shell and bake until the custard is set about 30 to 40 minutes. Test by tapping the side of the pie pan-the center of the pie should look firm and move as one piece. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool completely about 2 hours.  To serve: Slice the pie with a thin and sharp knife and use a pie server to transfer each slice to a plate. Serve with homemade whipped cream.  Finishing touch: A set of crust cutters makes it easy to add a seasonal touch for a presentation your guests will love.

For a gourmet touch sprinkle these mini delights with a touch of truffle salt for a crunchy surprise and burst of flavor.  Pie Filling  2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 large Vidalia or other sweet onion peeled and thinly sliced 5 sprigs fresh thyme plus more for serving 1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar 3 ounces Gruyere cheese finely grated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg for egg wash 1 tablespoon water for egg wash Truffle salt for garnish (optional)   Flaky Pie Dough (recipe follows)  1- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes  1/2 to  1/3 cup ice water   , Preheat oven to 375 degrees and place a rack in the upper and lower thirds.   To make onion filling heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add butter and olive oil and heat until butter foams. When foaming subsides add onions and toss to coat. Add thyme sprigs and reduce heat to low. Cook onions stirring occasionally until deep golden brown about 25 to 35 minutes adding balsamic vinegar about halfway through the cooking time. Remove the skillet from the heat and discard thyme sprigs. Stir in grated cheese and stir well to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Allow filling to cool completely.  To assemble pocket pies remove pie dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before rolling. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll chilled dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until the circle measures 16 inches wide and less than 1/8 inch thick. Using a 4-inch round cookie cutter cut 16 circles of dough rerolling once as needed. In a small mixing bowl whisk together eggs and water for egg wash.  Place 2 teaspoons of onion filling in the center of each dough circle. Using a fingertip or small brush coat the dough edge halfway around with egg wash. Fold uncoated dough edge over to create a half-circle shape and press to seal and remove any air bubbles. Place assembled pocket pies on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray. Continue with remaining dough circles and freeze assembled pies for 30 minutes before baking. Save remaining egg wash.  Remove pocket pies from freezer and cut a small "x" in the top of each with a sharp paring knife. Brush tops of pies with egg wash to coat and sprinkle with truffle salt if using. Place pans in preheated oven and bake until pocket pies are golden brown about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove pans from oven and allow pies to cool for 5 minutes. Using a large spatula transfer pies to a cooling rack to cool completely. Serve warm or room temperature.  Flaky Pie Dough  Yield: 1 9- to 10-inch crust   To make the dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring. Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.  Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.

Strawberry Orange Jam,Katy Hume,home/recipes/Strawberry Orange Jam,about 6 ( 1/2-pint) jars,  4 cups strawberries 1 cup fresh squeezed orange juice 2 tbsp grated orange zest  1 package Fruit Sure Jell Pectin 4 cups sugar or more  ,  Sterilize jars and lids: Wash jars screw bands and lids in hot soapy water then rinse well. Dry screw bands. Put jars on a rack in a boiling-water canner or a deep 8- to 10-quart pot and add enough hot water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil covered with lid and boil 10 minutes. Heat lids in water to cover in a small saucepan until thermometer registers 180 degrees F (do not let boil). Remove from water and drain jars upside down on a clean kitchen towel. Make jam: Wash and cut strawberries in half. Combine strawberries orange juice orange zest and pectin in a large saucepot. Bring mixture to a boil stirring occasionally. Add sugar stirring until dissolved. Add more sugar can be added if desired. Return to a rolling boil. Boil hard 1 minute stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Skim foam if necessary. Seal and process jars: Wipe off rims of filled jars with a clean damp kitchen towel then screw on lids with screw band just until a point of resistance is met - fingertip tight. Put sealed jars on rack in canner or pot and add enough hot water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil covered. Boil jam covered 10 minutes then transfer jars with tongs to a towel-lined surface to cool. Jars will seal (if you hear a ping that signals that the vacuum formed at the top has made the lid concave). After jars have cooled 12 to 24 hours press center of each lid to check that it's concave then remove screw band and try to lift lid with your fingertips. If you can't the lid has a good seal.

Madeleines with Honey-Lavender Ice Cream,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Madeleines with Honey-Lavender Ice Cream,24 to 36 madeleines,  Madeleines: 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter (6 ounces)  2 tablespoons softened unsalted butter (for greasing pan)  3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 4 large eggs A pinch fine-grain sea salt  2/3 cups sugar Zest of one large lemon 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Powdered sugar A bit of extra flour for dusting baking pan Special equipment: A madeleine baking pan regular or small  Lavender Ice Cream: 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup half-and-half  2/3 cup mild honey 2 tablespoons dried edible lavender flowers 2 large eggs  1/8 teaspoon salt    , Ethereal lemon-scented sponge cakes destined to inspire poetry from the first bite onward.  Madeleines: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Melt the 1  1/2 sticks of butter in a small pot over medium heat until it's brown and gives off a deliciously nutty aroma roughly 20 minutes. Pour the butter into a  mesh strainer covered with a paper towel making sure to remove the solids. Cool the butter to room temperature. By doing the butter first you can complete the rest of the steps while it is cooling.  While the melted butter is cooling use the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to grease the madeleine molds-get in there and make sure you get in all the ridges. Dust with flour and invert the pan tapping out any excess flour.   Tip: Cooking spray with flour may also be used to simplify this part.  Put the eggs and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Using a whisk attachment  whip on high speed until thick (approximately 3 minutes)-the eggs should double or triple in volume. Continuing to mix on high speed slowly add the sugar in a steady stream. Whip for 2 minutes or until mixture is thick and ribbony. With a spatula fold in the lemon zest and vanilla (just until mixed).  Sprinkle the flour on top of the egg batter and gently fold in. Now fold in the butter mixture only stirring enough to bring everything together.  Spoon the batter into the molds filling each mold 2/3-  3/4 full. Use a small cup filled with batter to keep things clean and manageable;  it is easier than using a spoon.  Bake the madeleines for 12-14 minutes (7-10 minutes for smaller cookies) or until the edges of the madeleines are golden brown. Remove from oven and unmold immediately. Cool on racks and dust with powdered sugar.  Lavender Ice Cream: (Special equipment: a candy or instant-read thermometer and an ice cream maker)  Bring cream half-and-half honey and lavender to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat; stirring occasionally. Remove pan from heat and let steep covered for 30 minutes.   Pour cream mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and discard lavender. Return mixture to clean saucepan and heat over moderate heat until hot.   Whisk together eggs and salt in a large bowl; Slowly add 1 cup hot cream mixture into bowl whisking while pouring. After mixed pour into remaining hot cream mixture in saucepan and cook over moderately low heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until thick enough to coat back of spoon (about 5 minutes). Temperature should register 170 to 175 degrees F on thermometer (do not boil).   Pour custard through sieve into clean bowl and cool completely stirring occasionally. Chill covered for at least 3 hours.   Freeze custard in ice cream maker. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.

Peach-Vanilla Bean Cobbler with Sugar Crunch Lattice,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/crisps-crumbles/Peach-Vanilla Bean Cobbler with Sugar Crunch Lattice,6 to 8 servings,  1 recipe Cream Scones (for dough): Click here for recipe »  2 3/4 pounds ripe peaches peeled or not according to your taste  3/4 to  1/2 cup (1 3/4 to 3 1/2 ounces) sugar plus 2 tablespoons for the lattice 1 vanilla bean or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 teaspoons cornstarch or tapioca flour or 4 teaspoons unbleached all-purpose flour Vanilla ice cream or vanilla cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che for serving   , This an example of the biscuit-topped variety of cobbler with a tender yet crunchy lattice covering warm vanilla-scented peaches. Remember that the biscuit dough needs to be rolled thinly about ¹⁄8 inch or the underside of the lattice will remain gooey rather than cooking through. The technique for weaving the beautiful lattice top may seem a bit intimidating but it's one of those techniques that is easier to do than it is to describe. An alternative is to roll the dough as described then use a 2-inch cookie cutter to cut as many shapes as possible (hearts or stars are two favorites). Arrange those shapes on the fruit in concentric circles starting at the outer edge and working inward slightly overlapping each row of dough.  Make the filling: Use a paring knife to halve and pit the peaches then cut into  1/2-inch-thick slices. Transfer to the large bowl. Taste a peach slice&#45;if it is sweet and ripe use only  3/4 cup sugar (or even less if it is very sweet). If it's tart or slightly under-ripe use up to an additional  3/4 cup. Place the sugar in the small bowl. Use the tip of the paring knife to split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Turn the knife over and use the dull side to scrape out all the seeds into the sugar. Rub the mixture together with your fingers until the seeds are evenly dispersed. Pour over the fruit. Add the lemon juice and cornstarch (and the vanilla extract or paste if using) and gently toss with the spatula until all the fruit is evenly coated. Press the fruit into the baking dish in an even layer.  Prepare the dough: Dust your work surface and the top of the dough with flour. Roll the dough into a 16-inch circle about  1/8 inch thick. Rotate the dough slightly each time you roll&#45;this will help you roll the dough into an even circle and will alert you immediately when the dough is sticking to the surface. If it does stick gently use a bench scraper to release the dough lifting it off the surface and adding a bit more flour to the surface to prevent further sticking.  Cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch wide strips. The strips toward the center of the circle will be longer than the strips toward the edges and this is fine. You will use the longer strips in the center of your baking dish when weaving the lattice and the shorter strips near the edges of the dish.  Weave the lattice:  Brush any excess flour from the surface of the dough. Gently lift the strips and place half of them about  1/2-inch apart across the top of the fruit letting any excess dough fall over the edge of the dish for the moment. Fold every other strip back halfway exposing the fruit underneath. Precisely at that halfway point place a strip of dough perpendicular laying it over the unfolded strips. Unfold the folded strips laying them over the new strip of dough. Fold back the strips that were left flat the first time and place another new strip of dough over the fruit and flat strips of dough. Straighten and tighten the dough each time you do this so your lattice looks even. Continue in this manner until you reach the edge of the pan then turn the pan and weave the other half of the lattice beginning at the center and working outward. Once the lattice is finished use the paring knife to trim any overhanging dough flush with the pan. Chill for 20 minutes.  Bake and serve the cobbler: Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Sprinkle the lattice evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. You may want to place a baking sheet or a piece of foil under the cobbler to catch any juices that may bubble over. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes until the topping is nicely browned and the fruit is bubbling and soft (the tip of the paring knife should easily slide in and out of the peach slices). Serve warm or at room temperature accompanied by ice cream or cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che.  <br

Goat Cheese and Citrus Cheesecake with Honey,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Goat Cheese and Citrus Cheesecake with Honey,8 to 10 servings,  2 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs  1/2 cup unsalted butter melted 11 ounces fresh mild goat cheese  2/3 cup granulated sugar 1 (15-ounce) container whole milk ricotta 2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon orange zest 1 teaspoon lemon zest 2 tablespoons honey   ,  This recipe is based on a classic ricotta cheesecake with a generous measure of goat cheese added. It lends a mellow acidic flavor that makes guests sit up and take notice of what is often plain-Jane second fiddle to New York cheesecake. Not anymore. This is for those who like their cheesecake a little less creamy a little bit lighter and bursting with flavor. Serve with the best fruit of the season. If you've ever eaten goat cheese paired with sweet ripe fruit you'll know it's a natural.   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat a 9 or 10-inch spring-form pan with butter or cooking spray.  To make the crust: Place the crumbs and melted butter in a medium bowl and stir with a fork to moisten the crumbs evenly. With a silicone spatula scrape the crumbs into the prepared pan. Press the crumbs in an even layer across the bottom of the pan working outward from the center. Bake the crust for 8 to 10 minutes until set and lightly browned. Transfer to a rack to cool leaving the oven on.  To make the filling:   Place the goat cheese and sugar in the bowl of the food processor and process until smooth and creamy about 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl once with the spatula. Add the ricotta cheese and process until incorporated and smooth about 20 to 30 seconds scraping down the bowl halfway through. Be sure there are no lumps left (you won't be able to smooth them out later). Add the eggs egg yolks vanilla and orange and lemon zests and process until well blended about 20 seconds. Scrape the mixture into the cooled crust.  To bake the cheesecake:  Set the cheesecake pan on the baking sheet (in case of leakage). Bake for 35 to 45 minutes until the edge is set but the center still has a 1-inch wide pool of liquid batter (it will firm up during cooling and chilling).   Transfer the cheesecake to a cooling rack and immediately run a thin flexible knife or spatula around the edge the cake gently pressing into the side of the pan to avoid gouging the cake from the side of the pan and prevent cracking as it cools. Let the cheesecake cool completely 1 to 2 hours. When cool cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours prior to serving.  To unmold the cheesecake: Run a thin knife or spatula around the cake edge again as described above. Pop the side off the pan. Use an icing spatula to loosen the bottom of the cake from the pan and then slide it off the pan bottom onto a cake cardboard or a serving plate.

Cacio e Pepe with Asparagus And Peas,Dinner,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Cacio e Pepe with Asparagus And Peas,2 to 3 servings,  Kosher salt as needed 8 ounces spaghetti or linguine 8 ounces pencil-thin asparagus cut into 1-inch pieces (about 1 cup) (see Note)   2/3 cup English peas (thawed if frozen)  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1/2 tablespoon very coarsely ground black pepper 1 ounce young pecorino such as Pecorino Toscano shredded ( 3/4 cup) plus more for serving 1 ounce Pecorino Romano shredded ( 3/4 cup) plus more for serving 2 ounces Parmesan cheese grated ( 1/2 cup) plus more for serving Coarse sea salt to taste Extra-virgin olive oil for serving  Snipped fresh chives preferably with blossoms for garnish   , As any Italian food lover will tell you there's no improving upon a perfect cacio e pepe-pasta tossed with tangy aged cheese and plenty of black pepper. But in springtime when asparagus and peas are in season even Romans aren't above occasionally tossing them into the pan. This is a fairly rich pasta so think light when planning the rest of the meal. A bitter green salad made with arugula or dandelion works well with maybe some vivid springy flavor of sorbet (lemon rhubarb or strawberry) for dessert.  If you can't find Pecorino Toscano you can use a Manchego or more of the Parmesan.  Note: If you can find only thicker asparagus slice them  3/4 inch thick instead of cutting 1-inch lengths.  Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until it is just shy of al dente about 2 minutes less than the package directions (it should be slightly underdone to your taste because you'll finish cooking it in the sauce). During the last minute of cooking add the asparagus and peas. Drain reserving  1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.  In a 12-inch skillet melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and add the pepper. Saute until fragrant about 1 minute. Add  3/4 cup of the reserved pasta water and the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet. Stir until the butter has melted and the sauce is beginning to thicken about 30 seconds.  Add the pasta peas asparagus and all three cheeses and toss until the cheese has melted and the pasta has finished cooking about 1 minute. Add more of the reserved pasta water if the skillet seems dry. Season with coarse sea salt to taste. Serve sprinkling each portion with more cheese and drizzling it with olive oil. Garnish with the chives.  Reprinted from Dinner: Changing the Game copyright &#169; 2017 by Melissa Clark. Photographs copyright &#169; 2017 by Eric Wolfinger.

Pork Loin Stuffed with Spinach Olives and Pine Nuts,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Pork Loin Stuffed with Spinach Olives and Pine Nuts,4 servings,   1 pound pork tenderloin  2 tablespoons olive oil divided   3/4 cup shallots   1/3 cup pine nuts   1/3 cup black olives chopped  3 cups baby spinach washed  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper    , Pork loin is a wonderful cut of meat it's lean succulent and tender. It takes a little patience at first to learn how to stuff a loin but once you have mastered the technique along with the carving you will find yourself exploring an array of flavor combinations.    Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F  and place the oven rack in the middle of the oven.  Start by cutting the pork tenderloin open by making one cut into the center along the entire length without cutting all the way through it. This opens the tenderloin with two-rounded sides. Next turn your knife horizontal to the countertop and cut into one of the rounded sides along the entire length without cutting all the way through it. Repeat with the other side.   To make the filling: Place a large skillet over a medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. When the oil just starts to shimmer add the minced shallots and saute slightly until translucent about 3 minutes. Add pine nuts olives and spinach. Cook until the spinach starts to wilt about 2 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.  To stuff and cook the pork loin: Spoon the mixture down the center of your opened tenderloin being careful not to overfill. Roll the tenderloin and tie it shut with cotton twine at 2-inch intervals.  Place a saute pan over a medium-high heat and add oil. When the pan is hot add the tenderloin and brown on all sides about 3 to 4 minutes per side.    Transfer the tenderloin to a roasting pan and put into the oven. Roast for 15-20 minutes or until an inserted digital thermometer reads 165 degrees F.   Remove the cooked tenderloin to a cutting board and allow rest for 10 minutes before carving.   To serve: Using a sharp slicing knife cut tenderloin across the grain into  3/4-inch thick slices. Divide slices between 4 warmed dinner plates serve immediately.   
Cider-Marinated Pork Medallions with Sweet Potato and Apple,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Cider-Marinated Pork Medallions with Sweet Potato and Apple,4 servings,  2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins trimmed 1- 1/2 cups sparkling apple cider divided Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons olive oil divided 1 medium yellow onion minced 1 medium garlic clove minced 1 large sweet potato peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes 2 medium Granny Smith apples peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes  1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth low-sodium 4 tablespoons minced rosemary  2 tablespoon lemon juice   , We have found sparkling cider to be the most effective and quickest option for marinating pork. Its acidic properties permeate the meat quicker resulting in a more tender and flavorful pork.    Remove the pork from the refrigerator and using a very sharp knife cut the tenderloins into 1- 1/2-inch thick slices. Using the heel of your hand flatten each slice lightly to approximately an inch.   Arrange the pork medallions in a shallow baking dish and pour 1 cup of apple cider over the meat ensuring all pieces of meat are covered in liquid. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate at room temperature for 25 to 30 minutes.  To cook sweet potato mixture: While the pork is marinating prepare the sweet potatoes. In a large nonstick skillet over a moderate heat add 2 tablespoons of oil. When shimmering add the onions and cook stirring occasionally until tender about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant about 1 minute. Add the sweet potato and cook stirring occasionally until just starting to soften about 10 minutes. Stir in the apples and continue to cook until starting to soften about 7 minutes. Add the remaining apple cider broth and rosemary and cook until the vegetables are tender about 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice taste and season with salt and pepper. Set aside and keep warm.   To cook the pork medallions: Remove the pork from the marinade pat-dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Place a large nonstick skillet on the stove over a moderate-high heat and add the remaining oil. When the oil is shimmering add the pork medallions and cook turning once until the meat registers 145 degrees on an instant read thermometer about 5 minutes. Using tongs transfer to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes prior to serving.  To serve: Divide the cooked pork medallions between 4 warmed dinner plates. Reheat the sweet potato and apple mixture and place over the meat. Serve immediately.

Maybe even better. We love how rotisserie frying creates extra-crisp skin while keeping meat tender juicy and packed with incredible flavor-no basting required. Best of all you'll have more room in the oven for side dishes and pie.   This recipe was tested with the Waring Pro&#174; Rotisserie Turkey Fryer and Steamer. Be sure to follow all the rotisserie use and frying directions from the owner's manual for proper operation and safety procedures.  Combine spices and generously rub over the entire turkey being sure to cover the interior cavity in addition to putting spices between the skin and breasts. This can be done by sliding your hand between the skin and the breast meat creating a pocket for the spices.  Once the turkey is seasoned and trussed let it sit covered and refrigerated for at least two hours or as long as overnight.  Allow enough time to bring the turkey to room temperature; fill the fryer with your preferred oil and heat it to 350 degrees F.   Insert rotisserie spit through center of seasoned turkey and attach securely to the rotisserie bar.  Slowly lower turkey into heated oil and fry for 3 to 3 1/2 minutes per pound. When the breast of the turkey reads 165 degrees  to 170 degrees F it is done. Note: always remove meat thermometer from turkey before resuming frying.  Carefully remove fryer basket from oil. Loosely cover turkey with aluminum foil and let it rest for at least 15 minutes before carving.  Slice serve and let the compliments begin!

Don't forget to purchase your turkey far enough in advance to account for thawing and brining times at least four days for a 12 pound frozen turkey.  For dry brining: Wash the turkey thoroughly in cold water and pat completely dry with paper towels. Place the turkey on a large cutting board and run your hand gently between the skin and meat to loosen the skin being careful not to tear the skin. Loosen as much skin as possible over the breasts legs and thighs. Rub the meat with kosher salt to coat the meat evenly again taking care not to rip the skin. Transfer the turkey to a baking dish large enough to hold it and place uncovered in the refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours.  To dress and roast turkey: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and place a rack in the lower third. Remove turkey from the refrigerator and transfer to a cutting board. Place  1/2 the melted butter in a small mixing bowl add chopped herbs and stir to combine. Rub the turkey meat with the butter mixture coating all parts equally. Gently stretch skin to cover breast meat completely. Using kitchen twine tie the legs together at the ankles and tuck wing tips under breasts.  Place a heavy roasting rack inside a large roasting pan and lightly oil the rack. Flip turkey breast side down and place on top of rack. Place turkey in oven and roast for 60 minutes turning the roasting pan every 30 minutes to ensure even browning. Check roasting pan to make sure pan drippings do not scorch adding stock or water as needed.  After 60 minutes remove roasting pan from oven and reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Using turkey lifters or clean kitchen towels carefully lift turkey off the rack breast side up. Return turkey to rack breast side up and baste with pan juices. Scatter onion carrot and celery pieces across bottom of roasting pan stirring to coat with pan juices. Return turkey to oven and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F 2 hours or more depending on weight. Remove turkey from oven place roasting pan on a heatproof surface and tent turkey loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Rest the turkey for at least 20 to 30 minutes before carving. Strain pan drippings pressing on solids to remove liquid and reserve drippings to make gravy.  To serve: Remove legs and thighs using a sharp boning knife. Slice the breasts into  3/4-inch slices and place on a serving platter with legs and thighs. Serve immediately.  Try our chef's recipe for Rich Turkey Pan Gravy:  Click for instructions »

Wood Plank-Grilled Salmon,Charlie Palmer Remington Camp Cooking,home/recipes/cuisine/bbq-recipes/Wood Plank-Grilled Salmon,4 servings,  1 1/2  pounds salmon 1 cup Remington Citrus Soy Marinade Red onion thinly sliced for garnish Cilantro coarsely chopped for garnish Lime wedges for garnish   , The secret to this recipe is Charlie Palmer's Citrus Soy Marinade which combines tart lemon with the sweetness of honey and a range of spices to enhance the delicate flavors of plank-grilled salmon.   Plank-grilled food is a great way to step up to gourmet grilling as well as help food retain moisture during cooking for perfectly tender results every time. When cooking with planks they need to be immersed in water at least an hour prior to grilling. A water-soaked plank produces maximum smoke flavor and is more resistant to charring on the grill.   Score the presentation side of the fish in a crosshatched pattern about  3/4 inch deep and 1 inch wide. Place the fish so that it fits comfortably in a sealable container (or cut to fit in large Ziploc) and pour the Citrus Soy Marinade over making sure that it also coats the underside of the fish. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 6 hours.  Place the fish scored side up on the surface of a wood cooking plank and place on a medium-temperature part of a covered grill. If using coals push them toward the outside of the grilling area. If using a gas grill turn one side up to medium or medium high and leave the other side off cooking the fish on the off side. If you feel the fire is a little too hot or want a little extra wiggle room place a piece of aluminum foil on the grilling surface before putting the plank down. The heat should still be sufficient to get the wood smoking.   Close the top of the grill and cook until the edges of the fish flake apart easily when gently pressed 10 to 15 minutes. Every few minutes pull up the lid just enough to check for flames which you can extinguish with a small squeeze bottle of water.  Top the fish with a scattering of sliced red onions and chopped cilantro. Squeeze the limes over and serve right on the plank.

Place the pork chops in a container that holds them snugly in a single layer. Add the brine which should cover them. Cover with plastic wrap. Alternatively put the pork and brine into a 1-gallon heavy-duty resealable food storage bag. Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. About 30 minutes before cooking remove the pork chops from the brine pat dry with paper towels and set aside to come to room temperature.   To make the pork: Prepare a moderate charcoal fire for indirect grilling or preheat a gas grill to medium (375 degrees F). Set the chops directly over the coals or gas flame and brown on both sides turning once for about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to indirect heat cover the grill and cook until the chops register 145 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer about 3 more minutes. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil while you make the sauce.   To make the fig sauce: Snip the stems from the figs with kitchen scissors. Cut small figs into half or larger figs into quarters.

The Eduardo Pork Tacos,Ed Kernan Sur La Table Culinary Manager,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/The Eduardo Pork Tacos,1 serving,  3 lbs pork shoulder - cut into  3/4 inch cubes 1 Tbsp sweet paprika 1 tsp poivron rouge 1 Tbsp brown sugar  1/2 tsp garlic powder  1/2 tsp ground fenugreek seeds  1/2 tsp ground cumin seeds 2 tsp salt 1 Tbsp Mexican oregano 1 small onion diced 2 carrots diced 1 cup canned fire-roasted tomatoes 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 1 dried amarillo pepper 1 dried ancho pepper 1 dried pasilla negro pepper 3 dried bay leaves Vegetable oil as needed Salt & pepper as needed Corn tortillas  Garnish: Diced poblano peppers Cilantro leaves Pickled red onions   , Take taco night to the next level. Tender pork has a delicious kick that is sure to make these tacos a crowd pleaser.  To pickle red onions slice a red onion thinly. Place in a container and cover with red wine vinegar 1 Tbsp salt and a few grinds of pepper. Put in the fridge for at least an hour; overnight is better.  In mixing bowl combine all spices and then toss with pork. Bring stock to a boil in a small sauce pot. Add dried peppers to stock turn off heat and cover. Let the peppers sit for about 30 minutes.  Place a large heavy pot on medium-high heat and add enough oil to coat the bottom thinly.  Test to see if pan is hot enough by adding a piece of pork. You should hear a sizzle. Add pork to pot. Depending on the size you may need to do 2-3 batches. Do not overload pot or the pork will not brown properly.  After adding the pork resist the urge to move it around. This will also prevent browning. Let the pork cook for 5 minutes. If the pot starts to smoke too much lower the heat to medium. Flip the pork and cook on the other side. Once the pork is browned remove and set aside. Pour off most of the fat that has rendered in the pot. You need just enough to cover the bottom of the pan.  Turn heat up to medium-high. Add onions and carrots. Remove peppers from stock and add to the pot. Saute everything for about a minute add tomatoes and cook for another 30 seconds. Add in stock bay leaves and pork.  Cook on simmer for about 30 minutes covered and then partially covered for another 30 minutes. Stir occasionally and skim off the layer of fat on the top. The process may take longer then an hour so look for the pork to absorb all the liquid and become very tender and dark in color. You want the final dish to be like a very thick stew.  Season with salt and pepper. Serve in warmed corn tortillas and garnish.

Next add water to the pot just until the meat is fully submerged (about 10-12 cups) add the salt and bay leaves and stir. Skim off any scum that rises to the top and let this come to a boil before lowering the heat to medium-low and allowing it to slowly simmer with the lid on for an hour and a half.  Once it nearly reaches the hour and a half of simmering make the sauce by adding all of the remaining ingredients to a blender along with a cup or two of the cooking liquid and blend until completely smooth.  Strain all of the sauce into the pot adding a little more water if needed (you want enough liquid in the pot to ensure the meat is just submerged) stir to fully incorporate the meat with the sauce and pop the lid back on to allow this to simmer for a final half hour or until the meat is fork tender.  Check the consommé for seasoning then carefully transfer the meat from the pot to a clean cutting board and gently shred the meat into bite-sized pieces with two forks. The meat should be extremely tender at this point.  Transfer the meat back to the pot and stir it into the consommé before plating and garnishing.  Enjoy!

Pear Sorbet with Champagne,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Pear Sorbet with Champagne,about 1 1/2 quarts,  3 pounds ripe pears preferably Comice  3/4 cup water About 1 1/2 cups sugar  3/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons brandy Champagne or other sparkling wine well chilled  , Thanks to their creamy texture ripe pears make a particularly plush sorbet. Adding a little brandy to the pear puree keeps the sorbet from freezing hard. For maximum effect top each serving with a splash of Champagne at the dinner table.  Peel the pears with a vegetable peeler. Quarter the pears lengthwise core and cut into large chunks. Put the chunks in a large saucepan with the water. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat then cover adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the pears are tender about 10 minutes.  Transfer the pears to a food processor and puree until completely smooth. Measure the volume then return the puree to the food processor. Add sugar in the ratio of 1 1/2 cups sugar to 4 cups puree. Add the lemon juice and brandy and puree until the mixture is completely smooth and the sugar has dissolved. Transfer to a bowl cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.  Freeze the chilled puree in an ice-cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. Because of the alcohol the sorbet will not freeze hard. Transfer the sorbet to a freezer container and freeze for at least 30 minutes to allow it to firm up before serving.  Scoop the sorbet into martini glasses or parfait glasses. Top each portion with 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of Champagne. Serve immediately.

Classic Swiss Fondue with Crudité,Sur La Table,home/recipes/appetizers/dips-spreads-sauces-seasonings/Classic Swiss Fondue with Crudité,6 servings as an appetizer or part of a multicourse meal, Fondue:  1 garlic clove cut in half 1 cup dry white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio plus more as needed 1/2 pound Emmentaler cheese grated 1/2 pound Gruy&egrave;re cheese grated 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  1 tablespoon kirsch (optional) Sea salt and freshly ground white or black pepper  Crudite for dipping:  1 baguette warmed in the oven and cut into 1-inch cubes  2 large sweet-tart apples cored and cut into 1-inch cubes  1 pound assorted raw vegetables such as broccoli cauliflower cherry tomatoes and carrots , Fondue can be made start to finish at the table with guests taking part in the whole process. To make ahead use a double boiler to prepare fondue that is ready to go when guests arrive!  1. Rub the cut side of the garlic clove around the inside of a fondue pot or around the inside of a bowl set over a double boiler if using (do not allow the bottom of the bowl to come into direct contact with the water). Add wine and heat until steaming.   2. Working over medium-low heat add cheese 1 handful at a time to the wine stirring until almost melted before adding next handful. Continue until all cheese is melted into the wine forming a smooth glossy melted cheese sauce about 10 minutes. (It's important that the fondue stay below a simmer under 150&deg;F once you start adding the cheese or the cheese may separate.) Once all the cheese is incorporated stir in lemon juice and kirsch. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   3. To serve: If not already in a fondue pot transfer fondue to a fondue pot to keep warm and melted at the table. Arrange bread apples and blanched vegetables on a platter for dipping. Have fondue forks or bamboo skewers available for dipping as well as small individual plates and extra silverware for each guest. If fondue begins to thicken too much at the table add small amounts of wine and stir to loosen it.  
Mom's Olive Oil Orange Bundt,Baked,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Mom's Olive Oil Orange Bundt,1 (10-inch) Bundt,  3 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder  1/2 teaspoon salt 4 large eggs separated 2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup plain yogurt  3/4 cup good-quality extra-virgin olive oil Freshly grated zest of 2 oranges 1 teaspoon vanilla paste or 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract  3/4 cup confectioners' sugar sifted for dusting    , Technically speaking this light and pleasing orange cake is not Renato's mom's. Renato's mom would be the first to admit this. It belonged to his mother's neighbor a lovely French woman named Annette who arrived and left their neighborhood in Queens before he was born. So yes this is really Annette's Olive Oil Orange Bundt (Annette from Marseille France to give proper attribution) but his mom adapted and baked it so many times he truly associates it only with her. Mom's Olive Oil Orange Bundt is great for breakfast with tea and coffee or sliced and served in the afternoon with a tart dessert wine.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously spray the inside of a 10-inch Bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray; alternatively butter it well dust it with flour and knock out the excess flour.  In a large bowl whisk together the flour baking powder and salt. Set aside.  In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the egg yolks until they are pale and light; slowly pour in the sugar until it is completely incorporated. Add the yogurt and olive oil and mix until thoroughly combined. Add the orange zest and vanilla and mix until just incorporated.  Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients in two parts beating after each addition until just combined (this will take about 10 seconds). Scrape down the bowl and beat again for 5 seconds.  In another large bowl beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Scoop 1 cup of the egg whites into the batter. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold them in. After about 30 seconds of folding add the remaining egg whites and gently fold until they are almost completely combined. Do not rush the folding process.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 40 to 50 minutes rotating the pan halfway through the baking time or until a small sharp knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Gently loosen the sides of the cake from the pan (I sometimes use an offset spatula for this) and turn it out onto the rack.  Just before serving dust the cake with the confectioners' sugar.  The cake can be stored at room temperature covered tightly for up to 3 days.  To Glaze or Not: Throughout Renato's entire childhood he enjoyed this cake sans glaze. I can only assume that his mom thought a glaze was unnecessary and too sweet. However I will admit that this quick-and-easy orange glaze makes a great visual and is a great way to use up the oranges you zested for the cake.    2 cups confectioners' sugar  3/4 cup fresh orange juice   In a large bowl whisk together the confectioners' sugar and orange juice until the glaze is pourable. (If it is too thick add a few more drops of orange juice. If it is too thin add a few more tablespoons of confectioners' sugar.) Drizzle the glaze along the crown of the Bundt allowing it to drip down the sides. Allow the glaze to set before serving.  Baked note: When making this cake try to use a really good fruity olive oil (Renato likes Paesano extra-virgin olive oil) to bring out the citrusy tones in the cake. Also you'll notice I skipped glazing this cake altogether (a rarity at Baked) because the simple dusting of confectioners' sugar is really all it needs. If you insist on a glaze though I won't stop you.

Grilled Citrus-Marinated Shrimp,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Grilled Citrus-Marinated Shrimp,4 servings,  1 teaspoon honey 2 tablespoons minced cilantro  1/2 teaspoon grated ginger 2 teaspoon lemon zest 2 tablespoons orange juice  3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil plus more for coating grill pan Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound large shrimp shelled and deveined   ,  The honey ginger and citrus flavors within the marinade highlight the delicate sweet flavor of the shrimp. If cooking the shrimp on an outside grill for ease of cooking you may choose to thread onto a skewer. This recipe is delicious on its own or with a salad such as spinach or arugula.

Parmesan-Herb Popovers,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Parmesan-Herb Popovers,12 popovers,  1- 3/4 cup (10 ounces) whole milk 2 large eggs 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  1/2 cup (2 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme 4 tablespoons (2 ounces) unsalted butter cut into 12 equal pieces   ,  Popovers are culinary sleight of hand. Their simple ingredients and mixing method belie the great heights to which they rise during baking puffing up like crispy brown balloons. All of the ingredients may be measured in advance but do not combine them until you are ready to bake the popovers. A popover pan is designed to optimize that rise with tall narrow cups that force the batter upward. You can bake popovers in a regular muffin pan although they don't rise as high and they develop a rounded depression at the bottom that when turned upside down is the perfect spot for some gravy. Popovers do not hold or store well so plan on enjoying them when they are fresh from the oven. If they have cooled reheat them briefly in a 350 degrees F oven for 5 to 10 minutes until warm.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and position a rack in the center. Once the oven is fully heated heat the popover pan in the oven for 7 minutes. In the medium bowl whisk together the milk eggs flour and salt until well blended. Add the Parmesan cheese and thyme and blend well.  Use a spatula to scrape the batter into a measuring cup. Remove the pan from the oven and close the oven door. Drop one piece of butter into each hole of the popover pan. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cups.   Return the pan to the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Turn the oven down to 400 degrees F and continue to bake for 10 minutes longer until the popovers are puffed and deep golden brown. Cool the pan on a rack for a couple of minutes. Remove popovers from the pan with a spoon or small offset spatula and serve hot.

Rosemary Flank Steak with Balsamic Glazed Onions,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Rosemary Flank Steak with Balsamic Glazed Onions,4 to 6 servings,  3 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves plus whole sprigs for garnish    1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil divided   3 large cloves garlic minced    1/2 teaspoon cracked black peppercorns    1/2 cup balsamic vinegar divided   1 1/2 pounds flank steak trimmed   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste   2 medium red onions peeled and sliced into  3/4-inch thick rounds   Fresh rosemary sprigs for garnish     , Crush the rosemary needles lightly with a rolling pin to release their volatile oil.  In a small bowl combine the rosemary with  3/4 cup of the olive oil the garlic cracked peppercorns and 2 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar.      Place the flank steak in a shallow non-reactive dish and pour the marinade over.  Turn the steak to coat both sides pressing the spices onto the steak.  Marinate for 30 minutes.      Preheat the grill to medium heat.  Clean the grill grates with a stiff brush then oil liberally to prevent sticking.  (Note: To use a grill pan preheat the pan to medium-high heat; add a very light coating of oil and heat through.)  Remove the steak from the marinade.  Brush off any garlic or spices clinging to the steak and season both sides well with salt and pepper. Place the steak on the prepared grill or grill pan and cook 2 to 3 minutes then without turning the steak over rotate it 90 degrees and place back on the grill or grill pan; this will produce beautiful brown cross-hatch grill marks.  Cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes.      Brush the top of the steak generously with balsamic vinegar.  Turn the steak over and brush the other side generously with balsamic vinegar.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes then rotate the steak 90 degrees; cook to an internal temperature of 125 degrees F for medium rare about 2 to 3 minutes or to 135 degrees F for medium approximately 4 to 5 minutes.  Transfer to a platter and tent loosely with foil.      Clean and re-oil the grill grates or grill pan.  Brush the onion slices on both sides with olive oil; season well with salt and pepper.  Grill the onions approximately 2 minutes on each side.  Brush the onions with the remaining balsamic vinegar and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.       Slice the flank steak on the bias into thin slices cutting across the grain.  Arrange the slices on a serving platter; pour over any juices that collected on the platter where the steak was held.  Place the grilled balsamic onions on the platter with the steak.  Garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs and serve immediately.  
Pork Tenderloin with Apples and Cranberries,Recipe developed for Fagor by America's TEST KITCHEN,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Pork Tenderloin with Apples and Cranberries,4 to 6 servings,  2 (12 – to 16- ounce) pork tenderloins trimmed  2 teaspoons dried herbes de Provence Salt and pepper  2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour  1 cup apple cider 1- 1/2 pounds Granny Smith apples peeled cored and quartered   1/2 cup dried cranberries 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter    ,  Cooking lean thin pork tenderloins in a pressure cooker is tricky since they can overcook so quickly. After several tests we found that even one minute of pressurized cooking followed by a 15-minute natural release turned out tenderloins that were overcooked.   Switching to quick release gave us slightly better control over the meat's doneness but the dramatic change in pressure at the time of the release caused the meat to turn tough. In the end we discovered perfectly cooked juicy pork tenderloins required removing the pot from the heat as soon as high pressure was reached then allowing the pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes.   Pork and fruit are a natural classic combination so we included a mix of apples and cranberries in the pot. Seasoning the pork with some herbes de Provence ensured there was a savory flavor to balance the sweetness of the fruit. We cut the apples into quarters to allow them to cook to the proper doneness in the same time as the pork and it also kept the prep easy. Apple cider brown sugar and a tablespoon of butter to finish created the perfect accompanying sauce.    Total Time: About 45 minutes less than 1 minute under pressure Pressure Level: High Release: Natural   Build flavor: Pat pork dry with paper towels and season with herbes de Provence salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in pressure-cooker pot over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown tenderloins on all sides 6 to 8 minutes; transfer to plate.  Add flour and remaining 1 tablespoon oil to now-empty pot and cook over medium heat for 1 minute. Whisk in apple cider smoothing out any lumps. Stir in apples cranberries and sugar. Using wooden spoon scrape up all browned bits stuck on bottom of pot. Nestle tenderloins with any accumulated juices into pot.  High pressure then naturally release pressure:  Lock pressure cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat. As soon pot reaches high pressure remove pot from heat and allow pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes. Quick release any remaining pressure then carefully remove lid allowing steam to escape away from you.  Before serving: Transfer tenderloins to carving board tent loosely with aluminum foil and let rest while finishing sauce. This will help redistribute the meat's juices. Next bring apple mixture to gentle simmer stir in butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice pork and serve with apple mixture.  Troubleshooting:   How do I know the tenderloin is cooked through?: We've never encountered underdone pork when preparing this recipe but the center of the tenderloin should register 140 to 145 degrees F before resting. If it is underdone simmer it gently in the sauce over medium-low heat until it registers 140 to 145 degrees adding water if the sauce becomes too thick.  Can I use other types of apples?: Yes but the flavor of the sauce and the texture of the cooked apples will vary depending on the apples you choose. Apples that turn very soft when cooked such as Red Delicious and McIntosh may turn into applesauce.  Do I need to alter the recipe for a 6-quart electric pressure cooker? Yes bring the pot to low pressure (not high) then immediately turn the cooker off and let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes; do not let the cooker switch to the warm setting. Use the browning (not the simmer) setting to simmer the apple mixture.  Tips: The only prep the tenderloin requires before cooking is to remove the sinewy silverskin which turns unpleasantly chewy once cooked. To remove it slip a boning knife underneath the silverskin angle the blade slightly upward and use gentle back-and-forth motion to remove it from the tenderloin.  Since this cut of meat is so small and lean it does 
Grilled Country Pork Chops with Bourbon-Basted Grilled Peaches,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Grilled Country Pork Chops with Bourbon-Basted Grilled Peaches,4 servings,  Brine 1 1/2 quarts water 6 tablespoons kosher or sea salt 1 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper Handful of thyme sprigs 2 cloves garlic peeled and smashed with the side of a chef's knife  4 bone-in pork loin chops about  3/4 inch thick 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons bourbon 2 teaspoons honey 2 large freestone peaches (such as O'Henry or Elberta) halved and pitted   , Grilling gives peaches and other stone fruits a flavor boost bringing their natural sugar to the fore. Use freestone peaches so that you can easily twist the halves off the pit. Baste them with butter honey and bourbon as they grill to give them a sheen then serve with a juicy pork chop brined for a full day to season it all the way through.  To make the brine in a medium saucepan combine all the ingredients. Bring to a boil over high heat stirring to dissolve the salt. Set aside until completely cool.  Put the pork chops in a container that holds them snugly in a single layer. Add the brine which should cover them. Cover with plastic wrap. Alternatively you can put the port and its brine in a 1-gallon heavy-duty resealable food storage bag. Refrigerate for 24 hours.  About 1 hour before cooking remove the pork chops from the brine and set them on a wire cooling rack at room temperature to dry.  Prepare a moderate charcoal fire for indirect grilling or preheat a gas grill to medium (375&deg;F) leaving one burner unlit.  Combine the butter bourbon and honey in a small saucepan. Set over moderately low heat stirring until the butter melts and the honey dissolves. Keep warm.  Pat the pork chops with paper towels to remove any remaining surface moisture. Set the chops directly over the coals or gas flame and brown on both sides turning once for about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to indirect heat cover the grill and cook until the chops offer some resistance to the touch but are still springy not firm about 4 minutes longer. If you are unsure of doneness measure the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer inserting it horizontally into a chop; it should register about 150&deg;F for medium.  Once you have moved the pork chops to indirect heat you can grill the peaches. Brush them all over with the butter-honey mixture and place cut side down directly over the coals or gas flame. Cook until they are nicely charred then turn baste again and cook just until they are tender and juicy. The pork chops and peaches should be done at roughly the same time but if not move whichever is done first to a cooler area of the grill to wait. Serve each pork chop with a grilled peach half alongside.

Butternut Squash Risotto with Black Truffles,DeLille Cellars,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Butternut Squash Risotto with Black Truffles,1 serving,   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup finely chopped onion 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 2 cups Arborio rice 1 cup dry white wine Approximately 6 cups of hot vegetable stock 1 butternut squash halved and baked in the oven with butter then mashed like mashed potatoes  1/2 cup grated parmesan 4 tablespoons unsalted butter cut into small pieces Medium to large black truffle   , This is a very cool dish because it is vegetarian yet the cheese and truffles bump it up to a red wine pairing.  It is perfect with the DeLille Cellars Merlot-dominant D2.  For the carnivorous add a short rib on top.  Vegetarian or not everyone is happy.  Do not fear the truffle.  As with many things they are available on the internet for most of year.  I like to shave them at the table to add to the experience.  In a heavy saucepan or wok heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and garlic and saute stirring continuously until just softened for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add rice and continue to stir using a wooden spoon to coat the rice with the oil.  Add white wine and continue cooking stirring often until it has been absorbed by the rice.  Pour in enough vegetable stock to cover the rice completely (approx. 3 cups) and continue to cook stirring often until all the liquid has been absorbed.  Pour in 1 cup of additional vegetable stock and stir/cook until it has been absorbed.  Repeat 2 more times.  With the last cup stir until the rice is al dente tender but still a little chewy (and most of the liquid has been absorbed).  Stir in the mashed squash and reduce the heat to very low so that the risotto stops simmering.  Stir in the parmesan and butter to give the risotto a nice creamy finish.  To serve: spoon it immediately into heated shallow serving bowls. Sprinkle a little more Parmesan over it and shave the truffle on top. Note: truffles not pictured.   
Pizza Dough,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing The Art & Soul of Baking,home/recipes/main-courses/pizza/Pizza Dough,2 (12-inch) pizzas or 4 (8-inch) pizzas,   3/4 cup (2 ounces) warm water (110 degrees  to 115 degrees F) 2 3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast or 1 3/4 teaspoons instant yeast 1 cup (8 ounces) water 3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) olive oil plus 1 tablespoon for brushing 3 3/4 cups (16 3/4 ounces) bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt Semolina or cornmeal   , Pizza is a hands-down favorite anytime anywhere. And while you can get good pizza when eating out truly great pizza is much easier to find at home mostly because you can top it exactly the way you want. This dough is a good starting point for your creations and can be stored in the refrigerator for 24 hours or frozen for up to 1 month. If you like lots of toppings roll the crust a bit thicker so it can support their weight and moisture. If you like a thin crust keep your toppings spare and packed with flavor. To help the dough slide onto the pizza stone dust your pizza peel with semolina. If you don’t have semolina cornmeal will work but it burns more quickly.  Mix rest and knead the dough: Pour the warm water into the bowl of the stand mixer. Add the yeast whisk by hand to blend and allow the mixture to sit for 5 to 10 minutes until the yeast is activated and looks creamy. Add the 1 cup water and the 3 tablespoons olive oil and whisk by hand to blend. Add the flour and salt. Knead the dough on low speed for 2 minutes or until it comes together in a cohesive mass. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cotton towel and let the dough rest for 20 minutes to allow it to fully hydrate before further kneading. Turn the mixer to medium-low and continue to knead until the dough is firm elastic and smooth 3 to 6 minutes.  Rise the dough: Lightly oil the tub or bowl scrape the dough into the tub and lightly coat the surface of the dough with a little oil. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled 45 to 60 minutes.  Prepare the oven: Place the baking or pizza stone in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Be sure to allow 30 minutes to 1 hour for the stone to fully heat.  Divide and shape the dough: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press down on the dough firmly to expel some of the air bubbles but don't knead the dough again or it will be too springy and difficult to shape. Divide the dough in half (or quarters if making smaller individual pizzas). At this point you can refrigerate or freeze all or some of the dough.  Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour then press down with your fingers (or use a rolling pin) to flatten the dough into a disk about 12 inches in diameter. Alternatively slip your hands knuckles up under the dough and lift it up then gently stretch the dough by pulling your fists apart. Rotate the dough a little each time you pull so the dough is stretched into an even circle. Brush any excess flour from the surface and underside of the dough.  Top the pizza: Dust the pizza peel with semolina and set the dough round in the center of the peel. Apply the toppings of your choice leaving a  1/2-inch border at the edges. The toppings should be in a fairly thin layer otherwise they will weigh down the dough and make it soggy.  Bake the pizza: Shake the peel or sheet forward and back to make sure the pizza is loose enough to slide. If it's stuck use a spatula to lift up the dough and toss a bit of semolina underneath. Once the pizza moves freely gently shake the peel or sheet until the pizza is at the very front edge. Open the oven door and set the front edge of the peel at the back of the baking stone. With a quick jerk remove the peel and allow the pizza to settle on the stone. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes until the dough is golden brown at the edges and across the bottom. Slip the peel under the pizza to remove it from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Brush the edge of the pizza with the 1 tablespoon olive oil to give the golden crust a beautiful shine. Use a pizza cutter or chef's knife to cut the pizza into 8 wedges and serve immediately.

Flatbread with Radishes Feta and Spring Herbs,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/appetizers/cold/Flatbread with Radishes Feta and Spring Herbs,6 servings,  Lavash (Middle Eastern flatbread) or pita bread Toasted walnut halves Radishes trimmed Green onions trimmed halved lengthwise if large and cut into 3-inch lengths (white and pale green parts only) Herb sprigs (such as basil dill mint tarragon Italian parsley and cilantro) thick stems removed but leaves left whole Edible flowers such as nasturtiums or borage  Whipped Feta:  1/2 pound Greek French Bulgarian or Israeli feta cheese  1/2 teaspoon minced garlic Pinch of hot red pepper flakes or coarsely ground medium-hot red pepper such as Syrian Aleppo or Turkish Mara  3/4 teaspoon dried Turkish mint or 1 teaspoon finely minced fresh mint 1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil   , When late spring brings the first flush of tender herbs edible flowers and mild radishes this Persian hors d'oeuvre should be in your repertoire. The concept is simple: you spread a little creamy feta on warm flatbread then wrap it around green onions radishes herbs edible flowers toasted nuts or any combination of these crisp and fragrant foods. The recipe is intentionally vague because the precise amount of each ingredient is unimportant. Focus instead on composing a beautiful painting of the fresh spring produce available to you.  If using lavash warm according to package directions until soft and pliable. If using pita bread preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Wrap the pita bread in aluminum foil and bake until hot throughout about 10 minutes.  To make the whipped feta put the feta garlic hot pepper flakes mint and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small food processor and puree until smooth adding up to 1 tablespoon more oil if necessary to achieve a smooth consistency.  Put the feta in a serving bowl. On a large platter arrange the walnut halves radishes green onions herbs and flowers attractively either in individual mounds or mixed.  Serve the warm bread with the platter of cheese and herbs. Invite diners to spread a small piece of bread with the feta then wrap the bread taco style around any of the other ingredients preferably in combination.   
Salt Crust Scallops with Thai Lime Dipping Sauce,Mark Bitterman Salt Block Cooking: 70 Recipes for Grilling Chilling Searing and Serving on Himalayan Salt Blocks,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Salt Crust Scallops with Thai Lime Dipping Sauce,4 servings,  1 (9- to 10-inch) square salt block   3/4 cup fresh lime juice  3/4 cup Thai fish sauce  3/4 cup water 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons toasted  sesame oil 1 garlic clove minced 1 hot chile pepper such as bird chile habanero cayenne or Scotch bonnet  stem and seeds removed minced  3/4 cup finely shredded carrot 1 3/4 pounds large wild-caught sea scallops (about 16)   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper   , Plump buttery scallops are salt-seared to golden perfection and then dipped in a tangy sesame-citrus sauce.  Place the salt block over low heat on a gas grill or stovetop for 10 minutes (see Read Before Heating!  Salt Block Cooking: 70 Recipes for Grilling Chilling Searing and Serving on Himalayan Salt Blocks by Mark Bitterman pg. 25).   Turn the heat to medium and heat for 10 more minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high and heat the block to about 600 degrees F about 20 more minutes (see Getting It Hot in Salt Block Cooking pg. 24).  To make the dipping sauce mix the lime juice fish sauce  3/4 cup water vinegar sesame oil garlic chile pepper and carrot; set aside.  Pat the scallops dry and pull off their white gristly tendons if not already removed. Season the scallops with the black pepper and let stand at room temperature until the salt block is hot. When the salt block is very hot (you should only be able to hold your hand above it for just a few seconds) place the scallops on the hot block and sear until browned and springy to the touch but still a little soft in the center about 3 minutes per side. Work in batches if your salt block cannot comfortably fit all the scallops at once.   Transfer to a platter or plates and serve with the dipping sauce.   
Orange Pecan Cinnamon Rolls with Orange Caramel Sauce,The Modern Proper,home/recipes/breakfast/doughnuts-muffins-more/Orange Pecan Cinnamon Rolls with Orange Caramel Sauce,12 to 15 rolls,  2 cups milk  1/2 cup vegetable oil  1/2 cup sugar Zest of one orange 1 package active dry yeast 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour divided  1/2 heaping tsp baking powder  1/2 scant tsp baking soda 1 1/2 tsp salt 1 cup butter browned 1 cup brown sugar 2 tbsp cinnamon  1/2 cup chopped pecans  Caramel: 1 cup fine baker’s sugar 1 cup cream 1 tsp salt Zest from one orange   , Heat the milk vegetable oil sugar and orange zest in a medium saucepan over medium heat. (Do not allow the mixture to boil.) Set aside and cool. When mixture has cooled to 100-110 degrees fahrenheit sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit on the milk for 2 minutes.  Add 4 cups of the flour. Stir until just combined cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside in a relatively warm place for an hour.  Remove the towel and add the baking powder baking soda salt and remaining  1/2 cup of flour. Stir thoroughly to combine.  Use the dough right away or place in a mixing bowl and refrigerate for up to 3 days punching down the dough if it rises to the top of the bowl.  Remove the dough from the pan. On a floured baking surface roll the dough into a large rectangle about 30 x 10 inches.  In a small bowl combine all filling ingredients until a soft paste is formed.   Using the back a spoon evenly spread the filling to cover the entire surface of the dough.   Beginning at the end farthest from you roll the rectangle tightly toward you. Use both hands and work slowly being careful to keep the roll tight. When you reach the end pinch the seam together. On a cutting board using a sharp knife make 1  1/2-inch slices. 15-20 rolls.  Lightly grease dutch oven well with butter. Place the sliced rolls in the pot being careful not to over crowd.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cover rolls with a kitchen towel and set aside to rise on the countertop for at least 20 minutes before baking. Remove the towel and bake for 13 to 17 minutes until golden brown. Don’t let the rolls get overly brown.  For the caramel sauce: place sugar in a small saucepan and just cover with water to achieve a wet sand consistency. bring to a boil but do not stir. Using a wet pastry brush clean down the sides of saucepan to remove any stray sugar crystals.   Continue to boil until the sugar turns amber. At this point quickly remove from heat.   In a small saucepan heat cream and orange zest to boiling point. Gradually add this to caramelised sugar stirring constantly to achieve a smooth consistency. This may take a while but it will eventually combine. Once combined add salt. (Timing is paramount with caramel. Both the cream and the sugar need to be really hot when they are combined.)  After the rolls are finished baking and still warm generously drizzle caramel over the top. Be sure to get it all around the edges and over the top. As they sit the rolls will absorb some of the caramel and flavor. It goes without saying that these are best served warm but they are equally delicious even if made a day ahead.

Sous Vide Maple-Glazed Carrots with Toasted Pecans and Mint,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Sous Vide Maple-Glazed Carrots with Toasted Pecans and Mint,4 servings,  5 medium carrots peeled and sliced into  1/2" thick rounds 1- 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup 1 tablespoon butter 2 tablespoons water 1 teaspoon salt  1/2 cup pecan pieces 1 tablespoon mint leaves cut into thin ribbons   , Celebrated by chefs from Heston Blumenthal to Thomas Keller cooking sous vide calls for slowly heating vacuum-sealed food in water at low temperatures locking in natural juices and flavors lost with other methods.   The color and flavor of cooking vegetables using sous-vide technology is unparalleled to standard cooking methods. Sous vide cooking allows us to cook at a temperature a bit below the boiling point of water so there is less risk of under/overcooking your vegetables. Furthermore sealing the vegetables before cooking in a water bath helps retain the natural plant sugars which would otherwise be diluted into a large volume of cooking water. That means brighter color and fuller flavor every time.  This recipe was tested with the Sansaire immersion water circulator. Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device's owner's manual for proper food-handling and safety procedures.   Discover more about sous vide cooking with the Sansaire:  Click here »  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange pecan pieces in a single layer. Toast in oven for 5 minutes or until fragrant. Remove from oven and allow to cool.  Choose a pot large enough to hold the carrots with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the pot using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Preheat the water to 185 degrees F. Place carrot rounds in a single layer into a zip lock bag. Add maple syrup butter water and salt. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the pot without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the meat. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag.   Slowly cook until tender 35-40 minutes.   Remove bag with tongs and empty contents of bag into a small skillet. Heat on medium-high heat to reduce the liquid by half tossing carrot rounds to coat. Season with salt and pepper to taste toss with pecan pieces and mint and serve immediately.  Note: The bag of carrots can be cooled in an ice bath and held in the refrigerator until ready to finish.

Cedar-Plank Honey-Bourbon Nectarines,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/dessert-sauces/Cedar-Plank Honey-Bourbon Nectarines,4 servings,  2 cedar planks   2/3 cup bourbon  3/4 cup honey  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 ripe but firm nectarines pitted and quartered  1/2 tablespoon lemon juice   , Cedar wood imparts a lush smoky aroma and flavor.  When cooking with planks they need to be immersed in water at least an hour prior to grilling. A water-soaked plank produces a maximum smoke flavor and is more resistant to charring on the grill.  Fully emerge cedar planks in cold water at least an hour prior to cooking  In a small saucepan over medium-high heat combine the bourbon honey and pepper. Bring to the boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer until the liquid has reduced by half about 5 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let cool.   Arrange the nectarines flesh side up in a dish just enough to hold them in one layer and brush with lemon juice.  Use a silicone brush to lightly coat the nectarines with half of the honey-bourbon mixture and allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.   Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium. Close grill lid and preheat to around 375 degrees F. Alternatively preheat an oven to 375 degrees F and place a rack in the center.  Remove the soaked cedar plank from the water and place on a grill rack. Close the grill and allow the board to heat for a few minutes until it begins to smoke or crackle. If using a plank for the first time season the plank by placing it on a preheated grill for 2 minutes turning once. Lightly toasting the plank on both sides will intensify its smoky flavor and prevent warping. When the plank starts crackling it's ready for cooking.  Using tongs arrange the nectarines cut side up on the cedar plank. Cover the grill or close the oven and cook until nectarines are hot and tender about 5 minutes.   To serve: Remove the plank from the grill or oven and transfer to a dessert plate. Drizzle with remaining honey-bourbon mixture and garnish with a dollop of freshly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.   
Nectarine and Raspberry Galette,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Nectarine and Raspberry Galette,8 servings,  Galette Dough: 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt  1/2 cup plus 7 tablespoons unsalted butter chilled cut into small pieces About  3/4 cup ice water  Filling: 1 1/2 pounds nectarines halved pitted and sliced lengthwise  1/2 pint raspberries 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 large egg yolk whisked with 1 teaspoon water for egg wash About 1 tablespoon sparkling sugar (coarse decorating sugar)   , You can adapt this galette to other summer fruits such as apricots plums or berries. In the fall fill it with apples or pears. The beauty of a galette-a tart with a wide rim of dough folded over the fruit-is its rusticity. It should look like a grandmother not a pastry chef made it.  To make the dough: Put the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to blend. Add half the butter and pulse just until the fat is evenly distributed and coated with flour. Add the remaining butter and pulse a few times just until it is coated with flour. There should still be pieces of flour-coated butter about the size of large peas. Transfer the mixture to a bowl.   Drizzle in the ice water while tossing with a fork adding water just until the mixture begins to come together. Gather the dough with your hands and knead gently if necessary to get it to hold together. Resist the temptation to add more water. Handling the dough as little as possible shape it into a thick disk like a hamburger patty then wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.  Preheat the oven to 425&deg;F. If you have a baking stone put it in the oven on the middle rack to preheat for at least 45 minutes.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 10 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. If it is too cold it will be brittle and difficult to roll. Unwrap the dough and place it between 2 sheets of parchment paper at least 16 inches square. With a rolling pin flatten the dough into a 15-inch circle.   To prevent sticking occasionally lift the top sheet of parchment and lightly flour the dough then replace the parchment and invert the dough so the bottom sheet is on top. Peel back that sheet of parchment and lightly flour the dough then replace the parchment and continue rolling.  When the circle is large enough remove the top sheet of parchment and transfer the dough still on the bottom sheet of parchment to a rimless baking sheet.   To assemble the galette: Working 2 inches from the edge of the dough place the nectarine slices in concentric rings. Scatter the raspberries evenly over the nectarines. Sprinkle the fruit with the granulated sugar.  Using a palette knife or other broad knife to help you lift the dough off the parchment gently fold the uncovered edge of the dough over the fruit to make a wide rough-edged rim. Make sure there are no cracks in the dough for juices to seep through. Brush the rim with the egg wash then sprinkle the rim with the sparkling sugar. With scissors cut off the exposed parchment paper. (It's okay if a little paper is exposed.)  Baking and serving: If you have a baking stone in the oven slide the galette still on the bottom sheet of parchment directly onto the stone. If you do not have a baking stone bake the galette on the rimless baking sheet. Bake until the crust is golden and the nectarines are juicy about 50 minutes. Slide the galette onto a rack to cool slightly. To serve slide it from the rack onto a cutting board and cut into wedges. Serve warm.

Fluffy Mashed Potatoes,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Fluffy Mashed Potatoes,4 servings,  2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks 2 bay leaves 1 tablespoon Kosher salt more as needed 3 to 4 ounces unsalted butter room temperature  2/3 cup heavy cream hot  2/3 cup whole milk hot Freshly ground black pepper as needed   , The russet potato also known as the baking or Idaho potato has low moisture and high starch qualities that yield wonderfully light fluffy mashed potatoes. They key to that fluffy texture is to process the hot potatoes in a ricer or food mill. It's also important to simmer rather than boil potatoes for even cooking.    In a large pot combine the potatoes and bay leaves and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat and add 1 tablespoon of salt. Lower the heat to medium cover partially and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork. Drain in a colander and discard the bay leaves.   Set a potato ricer on the rim of the pot used to cook the potatoes. Half fill the ricer with cooked potatoes and press them through. Repeat until all the potatoes have been pureed. Add butter and mix by hand using a silicone spatula. Add the hot cream and milk continuing to mix by hand. Taste and season potatoes with salt and pepper.  To serve: Mound the potatoes in a warmed bowl and serve immediately.  Cook's Note: you can create endless variations on mashed potatoes by adding a few flavorful ingredients. For instance replace the butter cream and milk with 2 heads of roasted garlic and  3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil for an Italian twist. Another option is to flavor the potatoes with  1/3 cup creamy Roquefort cheese  1/2 cup of caramelized onions and 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves.    
Himalayan Salt Slab Asparagus,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Himalayan Salt Slab Asparagus,4 servings,  1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1 tablespoon honey  3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil  3/4 cup thinly sliced basil leaves  1 tablespoon olive oil 16 asparagus spears trimmed   , Grilling asparagus brings out their natural sweetness and grilling them directly on a Himalayan salt slab imparts a subtle salty note to the vegetable.

Rack of Lamb with Mint Butter,Sansaire,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Rack of Lamb with Mint Butter,1 serving,  Rack of lamb Frenched (8 ribs) 2 tsp soy sauce  3/4 cup mint leaves 1 tsp sugar  1/2 cup unsalted butter 1 tsp lemon zest  Oil for frying Flaky sea salt to taste  , Choose a container large enough to hold your food with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the container using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator turning the silver temperature ring above the display to 129 degrees F. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.   Rub the rack of lamb with soy sauce to season. If available seal using a vacuum sealer. Otherwise place the rack of lamb into the Ziploc bag. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the lamb. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag and leave the lamb to cook in the water for 1 hour.  Meanwhile combine the mint sugar and butter in a small Ziploc bag. Remove the air from the bag following the same steps as above. Add the bag to the water bath with the lamb and cook for a minimum of 30 minutes up to 60 minutes. Open the bag and strain out the mint leaves reserving the melted butter. Refrigerate the butter until hardened.   To finish the lamb add 2 inches frying oil to narrow pot with tall sides and heat to 375 degrees F. Remove the lamb from the Ziploc bag and pat dry. Cut the rack of lamb into 2-rib segments and deep fry working a few at a time just until a golden crust forms on the outside about 60 seconds.  To serve: Top lamb pieces with a dollop of reserved mint butter and sprinkle with lemon zest and flaky sea salt.

Stilton-Stuffed Burgers with Caramelized Red Onions and Balsamic Vinegar,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Stilton-Stuffed Burgers with Caramelized Red Onions and Balsamic Vinegar,4 servings,  4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil plus more as needed 3 pounds red onions thinly sliced (about 4 cups) 4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon coarse salt  1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 pounds ground beef 5 ounces firm blue-veined cheese such as Stilton crumbled 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh Italian parsley   , This twist on the revered hamburger is so successful that you may decide to skip the usual toasted bun and squirt of ketchup. Rather than melting a slice of cheese on top like the classic cheeseburger these burgers hide it in the center. If you like blue cheese there's no greater treat than biting into a nugget of warm runny blue cheese. Serve the red onions as a side dish or as a topping for the burger.  Heat a medium skillet preferably cast-iron over medium heat. Add the oil and heat until hot enough to sizzle an onion ring. Add the onions adjust the heat to medium-low and saute stirring for 2 minutes or until evenly coated with the oil. Cover and cook for 3 minutes or until wilted. Uncover and cook stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat between medium and medium-low for about 20 minutes or until the onions are a dark golden brown. Remove the skillet from the heat. Transfer the onions to a large bowl. Add the vinegar salt and pepper to the onions and set aside. Rinse and dry the pan.  Divide the ground beef into four  1/2-pound portions and four  3/4-pound portions. Press one  1/2-pound portion into the bottom of the press and push the long end of the press into the meat to create a well. Divide 4 ounces of the cheese into four 1-ounce portions and add one portion to the well. Top with  one  3/4-pound portion of ground beef and use the press to seal. Repeat to make the other three cheese-stuffed burgers.  Grill over direct heat until thoroughly cooked. Spoon the onions over the burgers. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 ounce of cheese and the parsley and serve.   
Cranberry Vanilla Bean and Clove Glazed Turkey,Karlee Flores Olive and Artisan,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Cranberry Vanilla Bean and Clove Glazed Turkey,1 serving, For the turkey  Whole turkey thawed 3 medium sweet onions 32 ounces stock (chicken or turkey) Fresh sage a handful Fresh rosemary a handful Kosher salt Olive oil   For the cranberry vanilla bean clove glaze 1 1/2 cup fresh cranberries 1 3/4 cup orange juice 1 vanilla bean  1/2 teaspoon nutmeg  1/2 teaspoon ground clove  1/2 teaspoon salt   , For the turkey  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees . To prep the thawed turkey remove any parts from the cavity. Truss the turkey to ensure an even cook.  Stuff the turkey with sage and rosemary. Line the bottom of a roasting pan with onions that are peeled and halved. Pour in the poultry stock. Place turkey breast-side-up on a roasting pan fitted with a roasting rack. Generously drizzle the turkey with about two tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with salt until it&#8217s all covered. Massage the oil and salt onto the bird to make sure it&#8217s coated evenly and reaches the whole surface area of the skin.   Place in the oven on the middle rack.  Your cooking time will vary depending on the weight of your respective turkey as well as whether or not you choose to stuff the turkey (more than the recipe calls for). It will roughly take 15 minutes per pound.  While the turkey is roasting generously baste every 30 minutes. To prevent burning tent the turkey with foil if the skin is browned but the turkey isn't finished roasting. The turkey will be finished when the breast and thigh registet 165 degrees . If your turkey doesn't come with an inserted thermometer place a meat thermometer into the thigh toward the breast making sure to not touch the bone for an accurate reading.   For the glaze  Place one cup of the orange juice into a saucepan. Add cranberries beans from the vanilla bean ground nutmeg ground cloves and salt and place over low-medium heat. You want the mixture to slowly heat releasing the cranberries. If you rush this step the glaze will be too bitter. Continue to cook on the stove stirring occasionally until all the cranberries have burst and the mixture has thickened about 107#8211;15 minutes. Take off the heat and add remaining orange juice and butter. Mix until the butter has melted then set aside.   When the turkey is finished roasting take a natural-haired brush and generously glaze the turkey with the sauce. Place back in the oven for five more minutes. Take out of the oven and cover the turkey with tin foil for 10 minutes. Remove the tin foil and glaze an additional time before serving.  Note:The quality of the ingredients will matter in a simple recipe like this. Use free-range organic turkey and high-quality fresh olive oil. Grind your own nutmeg and cloves if possible. These small steps can ensure premium results on your big day!

Walnut Pesto Stuffed Pork Roast,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Walnut Pesto Stuffed Pork Roast,8 servings,  Brine:  1/2 cup coarse salt 1 cup hot water 2 quarts very cold water 1 cup ice cubes 1 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) boneless pork loin untied   Walnut Pesto: 3 cups packed fresh basil leaves 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil  1/2 cup chopped walnuts 2 cloves garlic chopped 1 teaspoon coarse salt  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper &#178;&#8260;3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese   ,  Brining time: 12 to 24 hours Prep time: 15 minutes Cook time: 1 3/4 hours   In summer when big bunches of fresh basil are sold everywhere take advantage of the bounty and make batches of pesto. Classic pesto is typically made with basil pine nuts and pecorino romano cheese but this adaptation is made with walnuts and Parmesan cheese and is slathered in the center and on top of the pork roast. Because the loin is lean brining is recommended for 12 to 24 hours before roasting.   Walnut Pesto: One day before roasting the pork make the brine: In a large bowl dissolve the salt in the hot water. Add the cold water and the ice cubes. Place the pork in a large heavy-duty resealable plastic bag. Add the brine and seal the bag closed. Seal it in a second plastic bag for reinforcement. (Or use any large container and cover it tightly.) Place on a rimmed sheet pan and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. When ready to cook drain the brining liquid and discard and then wipe the roast dry with paper towels. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before roasting.  Meanwhile make the pesto: In blender or food processor combine the basil  1/2 cup of the oil and the walnuts garlic salt and pepper and process until finely chopped. With the motor running slowly add the remaining  1/2 cup of olive oil and process until the mixture is well blended. Be careful not to overprocess the pesto. You should be able to see small pieces of basil throughout. Transfer the pesto to a small bowl and stir in the cheese.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Have ready a large roasting pan with a rack. Cut 8 pieces of cooking string each about 18 inches long or have ready silicone ties. Place the pork loin on a cutting board and butterfly it by making a slit along the side from the top to the bottom cutting just deep enough so that the loin opens up and lies flat like a book. Using a thin flat metal spatula or a narrow rubber spatula slather the cut surface with about  1/2 cup of the pesto. Fold it over and tie firmly but not too tightly at 1- inch intervals with the lengths of string or the ties.  Place the tied loin on the rack in the roasting pan. Roast for 45 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and slather about  3/4 cup of the remaining pesto on top of the roast. Continue roasting for 30 minutes longer or until an instant-read thermometer registers 135 degrees F. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes. As the pork rests the internal temperature will rise to 145 degrees F or medium-rare.  Using 2 broad spatulas lift the roast from the rack to a cutting board. Snip off the strings or remove the silicone ties. Cut the pork into  1/2-inch-thick slices. Arrange the slices overlapping them on a large platter. Drizzle any juices from the cutting board over the meat. Serve warm or at room temperature. Pass the remaining pesto at the table.

Basil Ricotta Ravioli with a Roasted Tomato Sauce,Kristan Raines The Broken Bread,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Basil Ricotta Ravioli with a Roasted Tomato Sauce,1 serving, Pasta Dough   1  1/2 cups + 2 tbs /188g 00 flour plus extra for dusting  1/2 tsp fine sea salt 2 large eggs Semolina optional for dusting    Ricotta Filling  6 oz well-drained ricotta cheese  1/3 cup grated parmesan reggiano 1  1/2 tbs freshly chopped basil ¼ tsp kosher salt Few cracks of fresh black pepper 1 large egg    Roasted Tomato Sauce  1  1/2 lb cherry tomatoes 1 small onion cut into 1/4-inch wedges  3 cloves garlic 2 tbs olive oil 1 tbs fresh oregano leaves  1/2 tsp kosher salt Few cracks of fresh black pepper   , Begin by making the pasta. Place a mound of flour on a clean work surface and form a well in the middle. Sprinkle the salt over the top of the mound then carefully crack each egg into the center of the well.  Using a fork begin whisking the eggs together while slowly incorporating the flour from the mound. Continue this process until a shaggy dough forms.  Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes or until the dough becomes elastic and smooth. If the dough seems too sticky add a little extra flour as needed. Shape the dough into a ball flatten into a disc and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.  While the pasta is resting prepare the tomato sauce and ricotta filling.  For the sauce place the tomatoes onion and garlic into a medium baking pan with 2-inch tall sides. Drizzle with olive oil and then add oregano salt and pepper. Toss everything a few times to combine and place in the oven at 400°F for 35-45 minutes or until the tomatoes have wilted and appear slightly charred.   Once the tomatoes are ready remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Add everything to a blender and blend until smooth. Taste and add additional salt and pepper as needed. Pour sauce into a saucepan and set aside.  For the filling simply mix the ricotta parmigiano reggiano basil salt and pepper together. Taste and add additional salt as needed then mix in the egg until well combined. Cover and store in the fridge.  Begin making the ravioli. Quarter the pasta dough. Working with one piece at a time (leaving the other pieces wrapped) lightly dust the quarter with flour and flatten it with a rolling pin until it's about as wide as the pasta roller and about  1/2-inch thick.   Feed the dough through the machine at its widest setting. Fold the long ends of the dough into the center flatten it and feed it through the machine again at its widest setting. Repeat this exact process two more times.  Feed the sheet through the machine at a width two settings narrower than the widest making sure to flour after it has rolled through. Repeat this at the setting two more steps narrower than the last flouring again. Repeat one last time at either the narrowest setting available or at the machine's suggested width for ravioli.  At this point the sheet will be really long so cut it in half and transfer to a large baking pan sprinkled with semolina flour. Repeat this process for the remaining pieces of dough making sure to sprinkle a bit of semolina between the sheets so they don't stick.    Dollop the ricotta filling 1 tsp at a time onto a half sheet of pasta. Place the dollops 1 inch from one another and fit as many as you can on each sheet.   Using a wet finger or a pastry brush dipped in water moisten the dough around each dollop of filling. Now place a second sheet of dough onto the half with dollops of fillings pressing around the filling to secure a proper seal between the two pieces of dough.  Use a small square ravioli stamp to cut out the pieces of pasta. Set these aside onto a sheet dusted with semolina flour. You should end up with 25-30 ravioli.  Once this is complete bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Meanwhile set the saucepan containing the tomato sauce to medium-low heat. Boil the ravioli for 3-4 minutes strain and add to the pot with the tomato sauce gently tossing to coat. Divide between 2 bowls top with freshly-grated parmesan reggiano sliced basil leaves and enjoy immediately.

When you make it with a whisk it will be loose and almost pourable. If you use a blender or food processor it will be firmer because generally more air is whipped into it.  Preheat oven to 200&deg;F and place a rack in the center. Set a wire rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and place next to the stovetop.  To prepare potatoes: Soak cut potatoes in cold water for 30 minutes. To an electric deep fryer or large Dutch oven set over medium heat add oil. Heat oil to 330&deg;F.  To prepare mayonnaise: To a medium mixing bowl add egg yolk garlic and water; whisk together. To a small liquid measuring cup add olive oil and vegetable oil stir to combine. While whisking the egg mixture vigorously add oil in drops to form an emulsion. Continue whisking and slowly drizzling in the oil to form a thick sauce.

This is the perfect gift-a unique homemade mustard blending the sweetness of dried apricots steeped in bourbon with the bright bite of whole mustard seeds.  Put the mustard seeds in a medium bowl and pour in 2/3 cup of the bourbon and all the water. Soak the mustard seeds overnight or for up to 24 hours.  At least 1 hour before you plan to make the mustard put the apricots in a bowl and pour in the remaining 1/3 cup bourbon. Macerate the apricots until most of the bourbon is absorbed (the apricots need to soak for a minimum of 1 hour or you can start soaking them at the same time you prepare the mustard seeds).  Before making the mustard wash the jars and lids in hot soapy water and dry thoroughly. Alternatively run the jars through the regular cycle of your dishwasher.  To make the mustard first strain the mustard seeds reserving the soaking liquid. Set aside the mustard seeds.  In a food processor fitted with the metal blade combine the apricots any unabsorbed bourbon remaining in the bowl cider vinegar honey and salt. Puree until almost smooth. Add the mustard seed soaking liquid and continue to puree until smooth. Add the mustard seeds and process until about half of the seeds are cracked and the others are incorporated but still whole.  Evenly divide the mustard among the prepared condiment jars leaving  1/2 inch headspace. Wipe the rims clean and secure the lids. Label and refrigerate for at least 2 weeks to allow the flavors to develop and mature.

Black Bean Noodles with Pork and Mushrooms,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Black Bean Noodles with Pork and Mushrooms,4 servings,   12 ounces dried wide thick wheat noodles (such as udon)   2 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil  8 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms stemmed and finely chopped  12 ounces ground pork  4 scallions white and light green parts minced dark green tops thinly sliced  4 medium garlic cloves minced   1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes   1/2 cup dry sherry  3 tablespoons black bean garlic sauce  1 tablespoon hoisin sauce  1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce  2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon unseasoned rice vinegar divided   1/2 English cucumber thinly sliced on the diagonal then cut into matchsticks   , This riff on Chinese zha jiang mian-or noodles with pork and fermented bean sauce-substitutes prepared black bean garlic sauce for the traditional and harder-to-find fermented yellow or brown bean paste. On its own the sauce tastes intense but its boldness is balanced by the neutral flavor of the noodles and the freshness of the cucumber. You can find it in the Asian aisle of most larger grocery stores. Make sure to thoroughly drain the noodles before portioning them; excess water clinging to them will dilute the sauce.  Don't salt the water when cooking the noodles; the sauce provides plenty of salt for the dish. And don't forget to reserve 1 cup of the cooking water before draining the noodles.  In a large pot bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until tender 5 to 6 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water then drain and rinse under cool water until cold. Drain well then set aside in the colander.  Heat a wok over medium-high until a drop of water evaporates within 1 to 2 seconds of contact about 3 minutes. Swirl in the oil then add the mushrooms and using a metal spatula stir-fry until softened and the bits clinging to the bottom of the pan begin to brown about 3 minutes. Add the pork and stir-fry until crispy and caramelized about 6 minutes.  Stir in the minced scallions garlic and pepper flakes then stir-fry until fragrant about 1 minute. Add the sherry and cook stirring occasionally until evaporated. Stir in the reserved cooking water black bean hoisin and soy sauces. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium stirring occasionally and breaking up any large bits of pork until the sauce has the consistency of thin gravy 4 to 6 minutes. Off heat stir in 2 tablespoons of the vinegar.   While the sauce simmers season the cucumbers with the remaining 1 teaspoon of vinegar. Divide the noodles among serving bowls then spoon the sauce over them. Top with sliced scallion greens and cucumber.    
Garlic Lemon Rosemary Roasted Chicken,Rebecca White A Pleasant Little Kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Garlic Lemon Rosemary Roasted Chicken,1 serving,  3- to 5-pound whole chicken (pasture-roaming chicken preferred)  2 tablespoons kosher salt (or less depending on the size of the chicken selected)  Freshly cracked black pepper (to your taste)  3 to 4 rosemary sprigs 2 heads of garlic halved 3 lemons halved 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil   , A whole chicken roasted with lemons garlic and rosemary will fill your home with warm and delicious flavors as it is cooked. Simple ingredients basic roasting techniques and an instant read thermometer will make the perfect roasted chicken every time.  Thirty minutes to 1 hour before roasting remove the chicken from the fridge and begin to bring it to room temperature. Placing a cold chicken into a hot oven will increase the cooking time as well as affect the quality of the end product.  Meanwhile set the oven to 425 degrees F.  In a small bowl combine the salt and pepper. Mix well.  Remove the insides of the chicken pat the chicken dry and truss the legs. Place in a cast-iron skillet Dutch oven or small roasting pan.  Pour about  1/2 the salt and pepper combination inside the chicken cavity. Then place the rosemary 2 garlic halves and 2 lemon halves inside the chicken. Don't worry if all the pieces do not fit inside the chicken. Each chicken is different as is the garlic cloves and lemons. At least get the rosemary 1 garlic half and 1 lemon half inside the bird.  Scatter the remaining garlic and lemon around the chicken.  Pour the oil over the chicken and massage it into the skin. Evenly sprinkle the salt and pepper mixture over the chicken. There may be some left over and that is OK. Again each chicken is sized differently and may not require as much salt and pepper.  Cook the chicken for 50 to 60 minutes. Place the thermometer between the chicken leg and breast. If the internal temperature has reached 163-165 degrees F the chicken is done. If not place the chicken back in the oven and cook for an additional 5 to 15 minutes depending on its temperature.  When the chicken is done remove from the oven cover the chicken tightly with foil and let rest for 10 minutes.  Break the chicken down and then serve with the pan juices. If you plan on using for later break the chicken down place in a glass container and cover with the pan juices. The chicken will keep for about 5 days.

Roll the dough through the machine catching it with 1 hand as you roll with the other. Take the dough and trifold it like a letter. Turn the dough so one open end faces the machine and roll it through on the widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting.    Continue rolling the pasta through the machine without folding adjusting the rollers to a smaller setting each time until the desired thickness is reached. If the pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.   To prepare pasta sheets:  Roll fresh pasta dough into sheets finishing on the thinnest machine setting. Lay the sheets on a lightly floured work surface and cut into even squares about 5 x 5-inches. Very lightly brush pasta with water. Working quickly so pasta does not become dry and brittle distribute herbs evenly across half of the pasta squares leaving  1/2-inch space around each leaf and a 1-inch border around the edges. Cover with the remaining pasta squares and press lightly to adhere. Adjust the pasta machine rollers to the second thinnest setting and gently pass the layered pasta squares through the machine. If necessary use a bench scraper to trim the pasta squares to fit inside individual shallow pasta bowls. Place pasta sheets on a baking sheet dusted with flour cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and set aside.

A Perfect Loaf of Bread,Andris Lagsdin The Baking Steel,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/A Perfect Loaf of Bread,4 loaves,  500 Grams All-purpose flour (I used bread flour)  375 Grams water 80 degrees F  1/2 teaspoon of active dry yeast 10 grams of sea salt   , This recipe is very similar to Jim Lahey's no knead pizza dough.  There are a few differences in the technique. A little more time and patience is required you can decide if it's worth the extra effort.   First whisk the flour and yeast next incorporate the water.  Mix and then make a well in the center.  Pour in the salt and let rest for 20 minutes uncovered.  Next we're going to fold each corner into the center one at a time. So fold turn the bowl and fold again.  Continue this process for about 1 minute.  Then let the dough rest for 20 minutes.  Continue this process 3 times but the 3rd time you'll notice a little bounce or spring in the dough. This is ideal.  Now you're going to let this dough rest covered for 7 hours and the dough will double in size. It's likely best to divide this work into two days. Leaving the dough in the fridge overnight is a good strategy.  Remove the dough and check out the beautiful air bubbles allow dough to sit a room temp for a couple of hours. It's going to rise a bit again...  Preheat your Baking Steel at 450 degrees F for about 45 minutes and place a sheet tray or pan on the bottom rack at the same time we're going to create some steam.  Flour a work surface with a combination of flour and semolina. Mix both well on top of parchment paper.  Remove the dough and place carefully on parchment.  You're going to form into a rectangle about 10- x 16-inch don't stress over the size.  Just not too thin....  Divide the dough with a bench scraper into 4 long strips and let rest for 20 minutes.  Now we have to launch the back of a sheet tray is a good tool. Slide the parchment on the back side of a sheet tray.  Carefully this dough is soft.  I did all four at the same time an easier strategy may be to start with two and then repeat.  Immediately after the launch place  1/2 cup of water into your steam pan.  Close the oven and bake for 20 minutes until golden brown. Boom! You're done...

Paella Mixta (with Shellfish),Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Paella Mixta (with Shellfish),6 to 8 servings,  Sofrito:  3 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup finely diced yellow onion   1/2 cup finely diced red bell pepper  1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 cup crushed tomatoes or fresh tomato grated on a box grater     1/2 teaspoon piment&#243;n  1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1 bay leaf    Paella:  3  1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  2 tablespoons olive oil  1 pound medium shrimp peeled deveined and tails removed  1 generous pinch saffron   2 teaspoons piment&#243;n  1 teaspoon turmeric 4 ounces Spanish-style chorizo diced into 1/4-inch pieces    1  1/2 cups Spanish paella rice  2 teaspoons sea salt  1/3 cup fresh shelled or frozen peas thawed  1/2 pound small clams scrubbed   1/2 pound mussels scrubbed and bearded  1 lemon cut into wedges   , To prepare the sofrito: Heat the oil in a paella pan or medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions stirring frequently until tender and lightly caramelized 5 to 8 minutes. Add red pepper and garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes piment&#243;n salt and bay. Reduce heat to medium and stir frequently until the sauce is thick and turns a deep brick red color about 10 minutes.   Bring chicken broth to a simmer in a large saucepan; reduce heat to low and cover to keep broth hot.   To prepare the paella: Push the sofrito to the side of the pan and add oil. When oil is shimmering add shrimp to the pan and sear until bright pink on both sides about 60 seconds. Transfer shrimp to a plate using a slotted spoon and set aside. Next add the spices to the hot pan and toast for 30 seconds. Add the chorizo and stir to combine with sofrito and spices. Ladle 3 cups hot broth into pan and stir in rice and salt shaking the pan to evenly distribute the rice grains. Increase the heat to medium-high and boil for 5 to 7 minutes or until the rice just starts to break the surface of the broth. Reduce heat to medium-low cover and simmer gently undisturbed for 5 minutes. During the process if the rice looks dry and undercooked drizzle in additional chicken broth. Remove the lid and tuck the shellfish and partially cooked shrimp into the paella cover and continue to cook for 5 minutes or until the rice is tender and the shellfish is cooked through. Remove and discard any shellfish that do not open.      Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high; cook for about 2 minutes until the bottom layer of rice starts to crackle and caramelize creating the socarrat. At this point you will need to closely monitor the paella and frequently move your pan around on the burner to evenly distribute the heat. With a spoon gently scrape a small portion of rice from the bottom peeking to make sure the rice is sticking and caramelizing but not burning (the rice should smell toasty not burnt). If the rice is browned and caramelized on the bottom of the pan and the rice grains are al dente (chewy but slightly resistant texture) remove from heat; sprinkle peas over the rice and cover letting the paella rest for 10 minutes.   To serve: Garnish with lemon wedges and serve family-style straight from the pan.

Champagne Vinegar-Roasted Shallot Mignonette,Cynthia Nims,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Champagne Vinegar-Roasted Shallot Mignonette,about  1/2 cup enough for 4 dozen half-shell oysters,  1 medium shallot   1/3 cup champagne or white wine vinegar  Freshly ground black pepper    , "The very classic mignonette commonly served with oysters is little more than red wine vinegar with minced shallot the bright and brisk flavor a complement to the briny-rich oyster. You can make that by stirring together one-third cup red wine vinegar two tablespoons minced shallot and a grinding or two of black pepper. This twist on that classic first roasts the shallot whole to soften its sharp flavor and uses white wine vinegar rather than red. Still brisk in flavor it's a bit smoother than the original." -Reprinted with permission from Oysters: Recipes that Bring Home a Taste of the Sea by Cynthia Nims &#169;2016. Published by Sasquatch Books. Photography by Jim Henkens.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.   Trim the root end from the shallot and peel away the papery outer skin. Wrap the shallot in a piece of aluminum foil and roast until it is tender when squeezed about 30 minutes. Set aside to cool.   Finely chop 2 tablespoons of the cooled shallot. Save the rest for another use (vinaigrette dressing rice pasta).   In a small ramekin or other small serving dish stir together the shallot vinegar and pepper to taste. The mignonette can be served right away or allowed to sit for 1 to 2 hours. Refrigerate if making more than 2 hours in advance. (See the tips for serving raw oysters page 48.)    
Sausage Mushroom and Sweet Pepper Pizza,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/pizza/Sausage Mushroom and Sweet Pepper Pizza,2 (12-inch) pizzas or 4 (8-inch) pizzas,  For the Sauce: 1 (14-ounce) can San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes 1 clove garlic peeled and minced 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  For the Pizza Toppings:  12 ounces pound sweet Italian sausage casings removed and cooked 8 ounces mini sweet peppers or red and orange bell pepper   1 medium white onion thinly sliced into rings  1 cup thinly sliced crimini mushrooms 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley 1 recipe Homemade Pizza Dough  Cornmeal or flour as needed 2 cups grated low-moisture mozzarella  1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes or to taste  , We recommend using mini sweet peppers for this classic pizza. The advantage of these little gems is that they play well with others and don’t drown the flavors of the other toppings. Also these peppers roast easier because the skins are so thin they do not require peeling like the bigger bell pepper. If using bell peppers choose only red and orange varieties as they are sweeter and milder than the green.     Place a pizza stone in the lower third of your oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Allow the pizza stone to preheat for at least 30 minutes.   To make tomato sauce: Drain the liquid from the tomatoes and transfer to a small bowl. Using an immersion blender pulse 3 or 4 times until the tomatoes are pureed. Stir in garlic and olive oil. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.  To grill peppers and onion: Place peppers on a grill pan over high heat cook until blistered and charred. Transfer peppers to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat procedure with onion rings. When cool to the touch cut peppers lengthwise to remove any stem inner white parts and seeds and slice into quarters.  Toss peppers onions and sliced mushrooms with olive oil and parsley. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.    To prepare pizza: Once your stone is preheated start rolling out your dough. Dust work surface with flour. Flatten one dough ball to a thickness of  1/2-inch and roll to desired diameter. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with another piece of parchment and proceed with remaining dough.   Sprinkle a pizza peel with some cornmeal or flour and place a dough round on the peel. Give the peel a little shake to make sure the dough moves freely and is not sticking.  Lightly coat dough with tomato sauce leaving  1/2-inch exposed around the edge. Sprinkle the dough with cooked sausage mozzarella roasted peppers onion and mushrooms. (A common mistake cooks make is to overcrowd the pizza with toppings which results in uneven cooking distribute toppings sparingly for a perfectly cooked pizza.)  Working quickly to minimize heat loss open the oven and slide the pizza off of the peel onto the pizza stone. Allow your pizza to cook until you have reached your desired crust about 8 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and place on a cutting board. Let pizza rest for 1 to 2 minutes before you cut it. Serve immediately. 
Chicken with Mustard,David Lebovitz,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Chicken with Mustard,4 to 6 servings,   1/2 cup (135g) plus 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard  3/4 teaspoon sweet or smoked paprika Freshly ground black pepper  3/4 teaspoon sea salt or kosher salt 4 chicken thighs and 4 legs (8 pieces total)  1 cup (100g) diced smoked thick-cut bacon 1 small onion peeled and finely diced  1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or  1/2 teaspoon dried 1 cup (250ml) white wine 1 tablespoon whole mustard seeds or grainy mustard 2 to 3 tablespoons creme fra&#238;che (page 327) or heavy cream Warm water (optional)  Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley or chives for garnish   , "Many years ago when prices were ridiculously low I bought an enormous copper pan at E. Dehillerin the famed cookware shop in Les Halles. This one-pan meal is a perfect fit for your largest most extravagant pot. This dish requires you to brown the thighs and legs. Unless you have a very large skillet or a Dutch oven fry the chicken in batches-you want them to have room to brown not steam which overcrowding creates. This dish is best served with a tangle of Herbed fresh pasta (page 230) which is exactly the right vehicle for sopping up the delicious sauce or Celery root puree (page 217)." &#8211Reprinted with permission from My Paris Kitchen by David Lebovitz copyright &#169; 2014. Published by Ten Speed Press an imprint of Random House LLC.  Mix  1/2 cup (135g) of the Dijon mustard in a bowl with the paprika a few generous grinds of the peppermill and the salt. Toss the chicken pieces in the mustard mixture lifting the skin and rubbing some of it underneath.  Heat a wide skillet with a cover or a Dutch oven over mediumhigh heat and add the bacon. Cook the bacon stirring frequently until it's cooked through and just starting to brown. Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on paper towels. Leave about 1 tablespoon of bacon fat in the pan discarding the rest. Add the onion and cook for about 5 minutes until soft and translucent. Stir in the thyme and let cook for another few minutes and then scrape the cooked onion into a bowl.  Add a little bit of olive oil to the pan if necessary and place the chicken pieces in the pan in a single layer. (If they don't all fit cook them in two batches.) Cook over medium-high heat browning them well on one side then flip them over and brown them on the other side. It's important to get the chicken nicely colored as the coloring-as well as the darkened bits on the bottom of the pan called the fond-will give the finished sauce its delicious flavor.  Remove the chicken pieces and put them in the bowl with the onions. Add the wine to the hot pan scraping the darkened bits off the bottom with a sturdy flat utensil. Return the chicken pieces to the pan along with the bacon and onions. Cover and cook over low to medium heat turning the chicken in the sauce a few times during cooking until the chicken is cooked through about 15 minutes. Check doneness by sticking a knife into the meat next to the thigh bone; if it's red continue cooking for a few more minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard the mustard seeds and the creme fra&#238;che. If the sauce has reduced and is quite thick you can thin it with a little warm water. Sprinkle chopped parsley over the top and serve.

Smothered Pork Chops,Quin Liburd,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Smothered Pork Chops,2-4 servings,  4 bone-in ribeye pork chops (about 2.5 lbs)  kosher salt freshly ground black pepper garlic powder smoked paprika 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons olive oil  1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 medium-sized white onion sliced and cut into half moons 4 garlic cloves minced 2 teaspoons fresh thyme destemmed 2 cups chicken stock  1/2 cup heavy whipping cream   , Use a paper towel and pat dry the pork chops on both sides. Season each pork chop with salt pepper garlic powder and smoked paprika on all sides. Then set the pork chops aside. In a large non-stick skillet (at least 10 inches or larger) melt the butter/olive oil over medium heat. Meanwhile while the butter/oil is on the stove; add the flour into a shallow pie plate or dish. Dip each pork chop into the flour coating well on all sides and then shake off any excess flour. Add the floured pork chops to a small baking sheet and repeat the process until all of the pork chops are coated in flour- but do not discard the remaining flour. When the butter/oil is sizzling add the pork chops into the skillet. Depending on the size of your chops you may have to cook them in batches. Cook the pork chops for about 4-5 minutes on both sides. Then transfer the fried pork chops to a small baking sheet and cover them with foil. Add the onions into the skillet and saute them together stirring every few minutes. Allow the onions to break down and caramelize until they reach a deeply golden brown color about 10-12 minutes. Then add in the garlic and stir together until fragrant about 1-2 minutes. Take 2 tablespoons of the reserved flour and sprinkle it into the skillet. Stir the flour into the onion mixture until all of the flour begins to dissolve. The flour should absorb most if not all of any butter/oil left in the skillet- making sure that all of the flour has fully dissolved. Sprinkle in the fresh thyme and stir together once more. Pour in the stock and heavy cream and stir to fully combine everything. Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the mixture to come up to a simmer. Stir together and then you should see the gravy begin to thicken. Taste the gravy and adjust it to your preference by adding more salt/pepper if desired. Then add in the pork chops and spoon the gravy over them. Serve the smothered pork chops warm and over mashed potatoes rice or alongside desired side items. Enjoy!

Apricot-Raspberry Upside-Down Cake,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Apricot-Raspberry Upside-Down Cake,8 to 10 servings,  Topping:  1/2 stick (2 ounces) unsalted butter cut into small pieces  1/2 cup (4 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar 4 medium (8 ounces) apricots 1 half-pint basket (6 ounces) raspberries  Cake: 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter softened (65&deg; to 68&deg;F) 1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar 2 large eggs at room temperature separated 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (6 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) fine cornmeal  1/2 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 teaspoon salt  1/2 cup (4 ounces) whole milk at room temperature Ice cream or whipped cream for serving  , A simple homey upside-down cake is always a welcome delight. These cakes have fallen a bit out of favor lately perhaps because people are afraid they'll end up with a slice of cake topped with canned pineapple rings and a fluorescent pink cherry. That's a bad rap for a dessert that so beautifully melds fruit of the season with warm-from-the-oven cake. A couple of tips: Take a few extra minutes to arrange the fruit in a pretty pattern in the bottom of the pan because when you unmold the cake the fruit will be the top&#45;and the decoration. Wait at least 30 minutes before turning it out of the pan to allow time for the juices to be reabsorbed and to ensure that the fruit will stay on top of the cake rather than sliding off in an avalanche of juice.  Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center.   Prepare the topping: Melt the butter in the skillet over medium heat then blend in the brown sugar. It will look grainy at first but will smooth out as the sugar melts. Whisk vigorously to blend the mixture (you do not want to see any pools of melted butter separating from the sugar). Once the mixture is melted and smooth pour it into the bottom of the cake pan. Set aside to cool.  With a paring knife halve and pit the apricots and slice each half into 4 wedges. Pour the raspberries out onto the baking sheet. Pick through them and discard any debris or molded berries. Do not wash or they will absorb the water and turn to mush. Arrange a row of slightly overlapping apricot slices around the outer rim of the pan. Then arrange a double row of raspberries. Fill in the center of the cake pan with overlapping apricot slices. Set aside.  Cream the butter with the sugar: Beat the butter and granulated sugar in the stand mixer with the paddle on medium-high speed until very light (almost white in color) 4 to 5 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl although you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape down the bowl with a spatula.  Add the eggs: Beat the egg yolks and vanilla in the small bowl to blend. With mixer on medium add the yolk mixture about 1 tablespoon at a time allowing each addition to completely blend in before adding the next. Scrape down the bowl.  Add the dry and wet ingredients alternately: With the fine-mesh strainer sift the flour cornmeal baking powder and salt into the medium bowl. If any cornmeal is left in the strainer add it to the bowl. Whisk to blend. With the mixer on the lowest speed add the flour mixture and milk alternately beginning with one-third of the flour mixture and half the milk; repeat then finish with the flour mixture. Scrape down bowl. Transfer to a large bowl.  Finish the batter and bake the cake: In the cleaned mixer bowl with a clean whisk attachment whip the egg whites on medium speed to firm peaks. You can also use the hand mixer. Gently fold the batter until no streaks of white remain (it will be quite thick). Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until the top is golden firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer the cake to a rack to cool for 30 minutes.  Unmold the cake: Run a thin flexible knife or spatula around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake. If the cake is very rounded press down gently to level the top. Place a serving plate on top of the pan hold the two together and flip over. The cake should slide right out. If it doesn't hold the pan over a medium flame on the stove for 15 to 20 seconds to melt the syrup in the bottom of the pan. Flip again. To serve cut the cake with a thin sharp knife and accompany with a spoonful of whipped cream or a small scoop of ice cream.  Storing: This cake is best served the day it is made preferably warm from the oven.

Served with Thai Chili sauce. In a small bowl combine vegetable oil fish sauce soy sauce brown sugar lime juice and garlic. Pat dry chicken wings and pour mixture all over.

Garnish with green onions and serve with Thai sweet chili sauce. Enjoy!  Notes:  Grill time will vary depending on many factors. Because marinade contains sugar grill chicken slowly on moderate heat (avoid high heat) so that the insides will be completely cooked without burning the outsides.

Salted Caramel Ice Cream with Chocolate Ganache,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Salted Caramel Ice Cream with Chocolate Ganache,4 to 6 servings, Ice Cream   1  3/4 cups sugar divided   1/2 cup water  4 cups whipping cream 6 large egg yolks 1 vanilla bean split lengthwise or 1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste 2 teaspoons sea salt plus more as needed Chocolate Ganache for serving (recipe follows)    Chocolate Ganache  Yield:  3/4 cup    3/4 cup heavy cream 8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate finely chopped  1 ounce (2 tablespoons) unsalted butter softened 1 tablespoon cognac or brandy (optional)   , Place 1- 1/2 cups sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber occasionally swirling pan about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully whisk in cream since mixture will bubble vigorously. Stir over low heat until smooth. Set aside.  Place egg yolks and remaining  3/4cup sugar in a medium mixing bowl whisking to combine. If using the vanilla bean use the reverse edge of a paring knife to scrape the seeds from the pod and add to the milk mixture. If using the vanilla bean paste add to the yolk mixture. Slowly pour the hot caramel mixture into the yolk mixture whisking constantly. Pour the caramel and yolk mixture back into the medium saucepan and heat over medium heat until mixture coats the back of a spoon about 3 to 5 minutes. Strain caramel custard through a fine mesh strainer into a heatproof medium mixing bowl. Place the bowl of caramel custard inside a larger bowl containing ice water and stir to cool as quickly as possible.   Place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the caramel custard and refrigerate until cold about 3 to 4 hours. Taste and stir in 2 teaspoons sea salt. Process in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer ice cream to a freezer-proof container and freeze until firm about 30 minutes. Taste again and add more salt until desired flavor is reached.  For Chocolate Ganache  In a small saucepan heat cream over medium-high heat to a simmer. Place chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and pour hot cream over the chocolate. Let stand for  1 minute. Slowly stir chocolate mixture with a rubber spatula to combine. Add butter and whisk mixture until smooth. Add cognac or brandy if using. Let cool to room temperature stirring every 10 minutes.   To serve scoop ice cream into chilled dessert dishes. Top with chocolate ganache and serve immediately.   Adding a small amount of sea salt actually brings out the flavor of the caramel in the ice cream. You may find that you need to add a touch more salt to the finished ice cream since cold foods often need a little extra seasoning. The ice cream will keep in the freezer stored in an airtight container for up to 1 week.

Frozen pearl onions will work in this recipe; however fresh will have better texture and flavor. Peeling pearl onions is easier after a short blanch.  Instant Pot Directions:  Set Instant Pot to Saute and add oil. When oil is shimmering add bacon and saute bacon pieces until lightly browned about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to a medium bowl and reserve bacon fat in the pan.    Dry the beef thoroughly with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan add the beef to the Instant Pot and sear turning as needed until browned on all sides. Transfer seared beef to bowl with bacon. Reduce heat setting to low and add the carrot and onion to the pan; saute until lightly browned about 8 minutes.   Return the beef and vegetables; season lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over and toss to lightly coat. Slowly stir in wine and add enough broth to just cover the meat. Stir in tomato paste garlic thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Lock the lid and select High Pressure setting the timer for 40 minutes.   While the beef is cooking blanch the pearl onions in rapidly boiling salted water until tender about 4 minutes. Drain and let cool. Trim ends and peel; set aside.   To a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat add butter. When butter is melted and foaming subsides add pearl onions and mushrooms and stir to coat vegetables with the melted butter. Drizzle with sherry vinegar and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook stirring often until the vegetables are tender and have developed caramelization about 8 minutes.   When the timer on Instant Pot goes off release the pressure and check the meat. If meat is not tender cook for additional 5 minutes or so. Remove the meat and vegetables to a bowl discard thyme and bay leaves. Select Saute setting on Instant Pot and reduce the braising liquid skimming off the fat. Add the sauteed onions and mushrooms. Continue simmering until the liquid reduces into a sauce and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Return beef and vegetables and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   To serve: Just before serving stir in parsley taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and ladle into shallow soup bowls.  Stovetop Directions:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Position 1 rack in the middle of the oven and make sure there is enough clearance for the Dutch oven with the lid on the top rack.    To a large Dutch oven set over medium heat add oil. When oil is shimmering add bacon and saute bacon pieces until lightly browned about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to a medium bowl and reserve bacon fat in the pan.    Dry the beef thoroughly with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Return Dutch oven to medium-high heat. When the fat is shimmering working in batches to avoid crowding the pan add the beef and sear turning as needed until browned on all sides. Transfer seared beef to bowl with bacon. Reduce heat to medium and add the carrot and onion to the pan; saute until lightly browned about 8 minutes.   Return the beef and vegetables; season lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over and toss to lightly coat. Slowly stir in wine and add enough broth to just cover the meat. Stir in tomato paste garlic thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cover the pan and place in preheated oven for 1  1/2 to 2 hours. The meat is done when a fork pierces it easily.  While the beef is cooking blanch the pearl onions in rapidly boiling salted water until tender about 4 minutes 
Mojo Pork Tacos,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Mojo Pork Tacos,4 servings,  1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1 teaspoon dried oregano Kosher salt and ground black pepper 2 pounds boneless pork butt trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks 1 tablespoon grapeseed or other neutral oil 1 large yellow onion finely chopped 8 medium garlic cloves minced 2 chipotle chilies in adobo minced plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce 1 teaspoon grated orange zest plus 1 cup orange juice 1 teaspoon grated lime zest plus 3 tablespoons lime juice  1 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro 8 to 12 corn tortillas warmed   ,  Cuban mojo is a tangy pungent garlic-citrus mixture that's often used as a marinade for pork as well as a sauce. We use it to balance the richness of tender shredded pork in these flavorful tacos. A pressure cooker helps us keep the cooking time weeknight-appropriate. Sour Seville oranges are used in authentic mojo; to mimic their flavor we combined regular orange juice and lime juice as well as their zests for fragrance. Though mojo is not typically smoky or spicy we liked the complexity that smoked paprika and chipotle chili added. For more heat use hot smoked paprika or an additional chipotle chili. Start timing the pork once it has come to high pressure. If you prefer instead of making tacos serve the pork over rice with sliced oranges and avocado.  Don't be shy when trimming the fat from the pork or the tacos will be too greasy.  In a medium bowl combine the cumin paprika oregano 1 teaspoon salt and  1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the pork and stir to coat. Set aside.   In a 5 1/2-liter or larger pressure cooker over medium heat the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook stirring occasionally until softened about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Stir in the chipotles and adobo sauce. Stir in the pork then the orange juice. Lock the lid in place and bring to high pressure. Adjust heat to low to stabilize pressure. Cook for 25 minutes.  Off heat allow the pressure to reduce naturally for 20 minutes then quick release the remaining pressure. Carefully open the lid and tilt it away from you to release the residual steam. Using a slotted spoon transfer the meat to a large bowl and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Use 2 forks to shred the meat into bite-sized pieces.  Meanwhile return the pressure cooker uncovered to medium-high and vigorously simmer the liquid stirring occasionally until reduced to 1 cup 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the lime juice and cilantro. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Pour  3/4 cup of the sauce over the pork then stir in both zests. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve with the tortillas passing the remaining sauce separately.   
Pizza Bianco with Four Cheeses,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/pizza/Pizza Bianco with Four Cheeses,8 (5-inch) pizzas,  1 recipe Neapolitan Pizza Dough (ingredients below)  Corn meal as needed  Extra-virgin olive oil as needed for brushing the dough 2 tablespoons kosher salt 8 cloves of garlic minced 2 tablespoons of finely chopped rosemary 8 ounces Fontina cheese 8 ounces Pecorino cheese 8 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese  8 ounces Asiago cheese  Neapolitan Pizza Dough Yields 4 (10-inch) pizzas or 8 individual (5-inch) pizzas.   2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour plus more as needed and for work surface  2 teaspoons granulated sugar  1 teaspoon kosher salt   1 envelope (2- 3/4 teaspoons) instant yeast 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil plus more for oiling the bowl   , Traditionally a pizza bianco is a simple flat bread topped with olive oil salt and rosemary. In this version we are adding cheese and garlic to create the ultimate bianco quattro formaggi!   Authentic Neapolitan pizza dough is a simple thin-crust pizza dough that originated in Naples in the 1800s. Originally pizzas in Naples were made with a simple tomato sauce and vegetables. Cheese did not become a usual topping until the 1880s.  To make the dough: Place flour sugar salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds to combine. With mixer running on low speed add water and olive oil and mix for 1 minute to combine. Increase speed to medium and process until dough forms a slightly sticky ball about 1 to 2 minutes. If ball does not form add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time and continue mixing until ball forms. Coat a large mixing bowl with a thin film of olive oil. Transfer dough ball to prepared mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest until doubled in volume about 1- 1/2 to 2 hours.   Once dough is ready press it gently to remove air bubbles and turn out on a lightly floured work surface. Using a bench scraper divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a tight ball cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for 15 minutes before baking.  To make the pizza: Place a pizza stone in the lower third of your oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Allow the pizza stone to preheat for at least 30 minutes.   Once your stone is preheated you can start rolling out your dough. Dust work surface with flour. Flatten one dough ball to a thickness of  1/2 inch and roll to a diameter of about 5 inches keeping the remaining dough covered. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with another piece of parchment. Continue rolling dough balls and placing on the baking sheet separating layers of rolled dough with additional sheets of parchment as needed. Cover stack of dough rounds with plastic wrap and set aside.  Sprinkle a pizza peel with some cornmeal and place a dough round on the peel. Give the peel a little shake to make sure that the dough moves freely and is not sticking. Using a pastry brush lightly brush about 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over the pizza base. Sprinkle with some salt garlic and rosemary.  Grate some of each of the cheeses onto the dough. Part of the fun of making pizzas at home is being creative. If there is one cheese you like more than the rest go a little heavy with that cheese.   Open the oven and slide the pizza off of the peel onto the pizza stone.  Allow your pizza to cook until you have reached your desired crust. Remove the pizza from the oven and place on a cutting board. If you let the pizza rest for 1 to 2 minutes it will be easier to cut.   Tips for Using a Pizza Stone   Before its first use wash the stone with water. Never use detergent.  Place the stone in a cold oven and preheat the oven. Typically pizza is baked at the maximum oven temperature between 500 to 550-degrees. Store the stone on the lowest rack of the oven so it's always handy for baking pizza or bread. Do not use the stone to bake breads with high-fat content because the fat will stain the porous stone.  Tips for Using a Pizza Peel   To prevent sticking sprinkle the peel with flour cornmeal or semolina before sliding it under the uncooked pizza crust or loaf of bread.  Place the pizza-shaped dough on the peel and then add the toppings.  Reach the peel into the oven and angle it downward. Shake it gently until the pizza slowly slides off the peel onto the stone. To retrieve the finished pizza slide the peel under the crust and guide it onto the peel.   
Perfect-Every-Time Center-Cut Tenderloin Roast,ChefSteps,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Perfect-Every-Time Center-Cut Tenderloin Roast,er roast,  1 Beef center-cut tenderloin about 1 kg Oil for searing as needed 30 g Butter divided 4 Thyme sprigs 1 Rosemary sprig cut in half   , Preheat Joule: Decide how you'd like your meat done. We like ours at a nice and rosy 140 degrees F / 60 degrees C.  Truss: Use butcher's twine to truss the tenderloin in three spots creating four even sections. (This will make it easier to handle.)  Sear: Set a large skillet over medium-high heat. Coat the bottom of the skillet with oil and when it's shimmering sear the exterior of the loin turning occasionally until it has a nice dark caramelization all over the exterior. This will take about two to three minutes total. (Remember we're only giving the exterior a quick sear not trying to cook it through.) Set the loin on a plate. Add half of the butter to the pan and when it's finished foaming add the herbs and saute them until fragrant removing the pan from the heat as soon as they turn bright green.  Cook: Transfer the tenderloin to a ziplock-style or sous vide bag add the cooking juices and herbs and set the bag into the preheated water. Cook for two hours. (You can leave it in there for up to two more hours if you wish.) Center-cut tenderloins tend to be about two inches thick but if you've got a three-inch-thick cut leave it in the water for an extra hour.  NOTE: When you are cooking above about 158 degrees F / 70 degrees C and you are cooking something heavy or poke-y opting for a heavy-duty sous vide bag is probably your best bet. That is because the seams of ziplock-style bags can fail at these temperatures. We buy really good freezer-style bags and we have rarely had an issue but there is a chance that the seams could fail. For more info check out our packaging guide.  Take a break: If you bought a nice piece of beef you probably have some sides to cook too. Now's a great time to do that. If you wisely asked your friends to bring sides crack a beer and kick back.  Finish with a quick sear: Set a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the remaining butter. Pull the loin from the water and pour the cooking liquid and herbs from the sous vide bag into the skillet. When the bubbling slows down return the loin to the skillet for a final sear quickly crisping the outside for about 30 seconds per "side" while spooning the hot liquid over the top.  Slice and serve: Cut into thick slices one or two minutes before dinner and serve to your lucky guests!

Java Mini Mads,Dorie Greenspan,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Java Mini Mads,24 mini madeleines,  ⅔ cup (91 grams) all-purpose flour 1½ teaspoons instant espresso (or 2 teaspoons ground espresso ground coffee or instant coffee)  1 teaspoon baking powder ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt ½ cup (100 grams) sugar 2 large eggs at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 stick (8 tablespoons; 4 ounces; 113 grams) unsalted butter melted and still warm   , b>Plan ahead: The batter must be chilled for at least 5 hours.  <brMadeleines rich cookies masquerading as tiny tea cakes are usually recognized by their scalloped-shell shape—it’s traditional (see Tea and Honey Madeleines page 000)—and beloved for their texture which is light; tight-grained; a bit springy the way the best sponge cakes are; and exceptionally well suited to dunking. In this version I’ve given the normally plain cookie a memorable new flavor and an even lovelier texture. The madeleines are made with coffee and cinnamon (like cappuccino) and baked in mini muffin tins (if you’d like you can use classic madeleine pans; see Playing Around). The tins up the ratio of well browned lightly crunchy crust to glorious crumb increasing their irresistibility and their dunkability too.   Whisk the flour espresso or coffee baking powder cinnamon and salt together. Working in a medium bowl whisk the sugar and eggs together energetically beating for about 2 minutes—you want the mixture to pale and thicken a little. Whisk in the vanilla. Switch to a flexible spatula and gently stir in the flour mixture. When it is fully incorporated fold and stir in the melted butter using a light touch. Press a piece of plastic against the surface of the batter and refrigerate for at least 5 hours. (The batter can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)   When you’re ready to bake: Center a rack in the oven and preheat it to 400 degrees F. Generously butter two mini muffin tins. (If you’ve got only one tin work in batches—keep the remaining batter in the fridge until you’re ready for it.) Or use baker’s spray. Divide the batter evenly among the cups—I use a small cookie scoop (with a capacity of about 2 teaspoons) to do this.   Bake the minis for 11 to 13 minutes or until they’re golden brown and feel springy when gently prodded—they’ll have beautiful round humps in the center. As soon as you take the pan out of the oven rap it against the counter to loosen the madeleines. If any stick gently pry them out with a table knife. Serve now when they’re still warm and at their lightest or let cool on a rack and serve at room temperature.  Storing: The mads are best soon after they are baked. They can be kept covered at room temperature for up to 1 day but their texture will get a bit denser.  The batter will make a dozen full-size madeleines. Butter and flour the madeleine pan or use baker’s spray divide the batter among the molds and bake for 12 to 13 minutes.

Set the pan and remaining cornstarch mixture aside for later use.  Pour gelatin and cold water into your stand mixer bowl and combine. Set aside.  Combine sugar water honey and corn syrup in medium saucepan. Using a spatula stir the mixture to combine the ingredients. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and cook the sugar mixture on high heat without stirring until it reaches 245 degrees F. The mixture will foam and bubble; this is normal.  When the sugar mixture reaches 245 degrees F immediately remove from heat and pour directly onto the gelatin. Use a spatula to scrape the sides and mix with the bloomed gelatin.  Using the whisk attachment whip on high speed until white soft peaks are reached about 5-7 minutes.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold the preserves or jam into the marshmallow.  Pour the marshmallow into the prepared pan. Use a spatula to spread smooth and level the marshmallow then dust the top with a light layer of the cornstarch mixture.

Feta Roasted Pepper and Basil Muffins,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Feta Roasted Pepper and Basil Muffins,12 muffins,  2 cups (10 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder  1/2 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 teaspoon salt  3/4 cup (3 ounces) crumbled feta cheese  1/2 cup (4 ounces) jarred roasted red bell pepper patted dry and chopped into  1/2-inch dice 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil 1 cup (8 ounces) buttermilk  3/4 cup (2 ounces) olive oil 1 large egg   , Who says muffins have to be sweet? These are a great savory accompaniment to eggs or bacon on the breakfast table and just as good alongside soup salad or roasted chicken. Do not substitute dried basil because it just doesn't have the punch of flavor these muffins require. If fresh basil is unavailable substitute a tablespoon of fresh thyme or a teaspoon of dried thyme instead.  Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat the muffin tin with melted buter oil or high-heat canola-oil spray. Whisk the flour baking powder baking soda and salt in the large mixing bowl. Set aside. In the medium bowl stir together the feta cheese roasted bell pepper and chopped basil. Set aside.  Pour the buttermilk into the measuring cup. Add the olive oil and the egg and whisk together until well blended. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the well and stir gently with a spatula. Mix only until there are no more streaks of flour or pools of liquid and the batter looks fairly smooth. A few small lumps scattered throughout are fine&#45;they will disappear during baking. Gently fold in the feta cheese mixture until evenly distributed in the batter.  Use the large ice cream scoop or 2 soup spoons to divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until the tops feel firm and a skewer inserted into the centers comes out clean. Transfer the muffin tin to a rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Gently run a thin knife or spatula around each muffin to free it from the pan lift out the muffins and transfer them to a rack to finish cooling (careful these are tender while hot). Serve warm.  Storing: When completely cool the muffins can be stored at room temperature wrapped in plastic or sealed in a resealable plastic bag for 2 days. Reheat wrapped in foil in a 325&deg;F oven for 8 to 10 minutes until warmed through. The muffins can also be frozen for up to 1 month wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and then sealed in a resealable plastic freezer bag. Thaw still wrapped for 30 minutes before reheating.

To make the rosotto:: Heat a 6-quart Staub cocotte over medium high. Sweat onion until translucent in a small amount of canola.   Add rice and sweat very low heat to bloom the grain.  Add white wine and simmer until nearly reduced.  Add H2O and simmer until nearly reduced.  Add vegetable or chicken stock and reduce until rice is cooked 95% through or al dente. Rice should be cream’ at this stage due to starch developing in the pot. Season with salt.  Add mushroom duxelle and stir to incorporate.  Add butter piece by piece and stir to incorporate.   Add parmesan and stir to incorporate. Consistency should be thick and creamy not stiff or dry at all.   Taste and adjust seasoning with salt pepper and lemon juice as needed.   Split evenly into 6 bowls. Garnish each bowl with additional sautéed mushrooms reserved parmesan chives and chervil by dividing each of these items and spreading evenly over the top of each bowl.   Note from Julia: I add some salt at this stage so that the rice has some seasoning to start but am not too aggressive since the puree is seasoned and the parmesan has quite a bit of salt.

I like the flavor of chervil with corn but chives work well too. Serve as a first course or as an accompaniment to poultry or meat.   Using 1 tablespoon of the butter butter six 1-cup souffle dishes. Coat the dishes with the bread crumbs. Refrigerate.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a saucepan.

Green Tomato Shakshuka,All-Clad & Chef Hugh Acheson,home/recipes/breakfast/egg-dishes/Green Tomato Shakshuka,4 servings,  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  1 medium yellow onion minced  1 poblano pepper cored seeded and finely diced 1 jalape&#241;o pepper cored seeded and finely diced 2 cloves garlic minced  1/2 teaspoon cumin Pinch of cayenne  1/2 cup cilantro stems finely minced  3/4 cup cilantro leaves to garnish  3 medium sized green tomatoes diced  1 cup chicken stock 1 cup feta cheese 1 teaspoon kosher salt 8 eggs    ,  The new hipster staple egg dish is a crowd pleaser and this version takes on a different profile by using green tomatoes in place of red ones. Green tomatoes cook down into a sweet delight of a stew and then the eggs get added and the skillet does the rest. This is hands down the most rewarding brunch dish you will make in a while and so easy to boot. And using that All-Clad Electric Skillet is a great way to free up space on the stove when the brunch crowd starts gathering in your kitchen.   With the skillet set at 375 degrees F sweat onion for 5 mins. Then add poblano jalape&#241;o and garlic and cook for another 5 mins. Add cumin hearty pinch of cayenne and  1/2 cup cilantro stems. Add the green tomatoes and cook for another 3 mins then add chicken stock. Then sprinkle feta around the skillet and add salt. Let cook for 3 mins.   Now to get the eggs we need we need to remove about  2/3 of the egg whites. This will help the eggs cook to a nice custard-like texture. Gather four small ramekins and set nearby. To remove egg whites gently crack the egg and cup the egg yolk back and forth between the halves until some of the whites are removed. Add the egg yolks to the ramekins with two yolks in each. Once separated add egg yolks (in their pairs) to their own separate spaces in the electric skillet. Lower to 300 degrees F cover and cook for 10 mins. Once the yolks are beginning to custard and the bit of remaining egg whites are beginning to set turn off skillet. Garnish with cilantro leaves and serve in small bowls giving each bowl its pair of cooked eggs.

All the vegetables and herbs come from her Nitty Gritty Dirt Farm; even the honey is harvested from farm hives.  Put the vegetables parsley garlic and salt in a large pot. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat stirring occasionally. Adjust the heat to maintain a brisk simmer and cook until the tomatoes are soft about 30 minutes. Pass the mixture through a food mill fitted with the fine disk and return the puree to the pot.  Put the bay leaves clove mustard seed allspice coriander seed peppercorns and cinnamon stick on a square of cheesecloth then tie with kitchen twine to make a spice bag. Add to the pot with the honey. Simmer over moderate heat stirring occasionally until the mixture has reduced by half about 1 hour. Remove the spice bag and add the vinegar. Continue to simmer stirring as needed to prevent sticking until the mixture reaches the desired thickness or about 3 cups.  Fill a canning kettle with enough water to cover 3 half-pint canning jars (or 1 pint jar and 1 half-pint jar) resting on the preserving rack. Bring to a boil. Wash the jars with hot soapy water; rinse well and keep upside down on a clean dish towel until you are ready to fill them. Put 3 new lids (never reuse lids) in a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water.  Using a ladle and a funnel transfer the ketchup to the jars leaving  1/2-inch headspace. Wipe the rims clean with a damp paper towel. Top with lids and then a screw band. Close tightly.  Place the jars on the preserving rack and lower it into the canning kettle. If the water doesn't cover the jars add boiling water from a tea kettle. Cover the canning kettle. After the water returns to a boil boil for 15 minutes. With a jar lifter transfer the jars to a rack to cool completely. Do not touch the jars again until you hear the pops that indicate that the lids have sealed. You can confirm that a lid has sealed by pressing the center with your finger. If it gives it has not sealed and the contents should be refrigerated and used within a week. Store the sealed jars in a cool dark place for at least 2 weeks before using. They will keep for up to 1 year before opening. Refrigerate after opening.

Be Creative Sugar Cookies,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing So Sweet!,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Be Creative Sugar Cookies,25 to 30 fun shapes,  Cookies: 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter softened  3/4 cup sugar 1 large egg at room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2  3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon salt  Icing: 3 cups powdered sugar  3/4 cup meringue powder  3/4 cup water Food coloring in various colors to decorate Sprinkles sugar pearls large crystal sugar dragees and/or candies   , Here's  a deliciously crisp and tender sugar cookie that can assume many shapes and be served as is or sandwiched with jam chocolate or your favorite filling.  Position 1 oven rack in the top third of the oven and 1 oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Make the cookies. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl. Using a mixer beat on low speed for 1 minute. Turn up the speed to medium and beat for another minute. The mixture should be blended and smooth. Turn off the mixer. Using a silicone spatula scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on medium-low speed until well blended. Turn off the mixer. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.   Put the flour and salt into a medium bowl and whisk until blended. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and beat on low speed just until the ingredients are blended and no patches of flour are visible. The mixture will have the texture of gravel and pebbles. Scrape down the bowl one last time and make sure no clumps of flour are hiding in the bottom.  Dump the clumps of dough onto your work surface and squeeze them together until they form a cohesive dough. Flatten the dough into a 9-inch circle wrap in plastic or parchment and chill for 30 minutes before continuing.  Place a large sheet of parchment paper on your work surface about the size of a baking sheet. Have a second parchment sheet the same size ready. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it in the center of the first parchment sheet. Top with the second parchment sheet and flatten the dough slightly. Using a rolling pin and starting from the edge closest to you roll gently but firmly to the edge opposite you and then back again twice. Be careful not to roll the pin off the edge of the dough or the dough will stick to the paper. Turn the dough between the parchment paper a quarter turn and roll up and back again twice. Repeat rolling up and back and turning until the dough is  3/4 inch thick.  If the paper creases into the dough gently peel back the paper straighten it out and smooth it back on top of the dough. You'll need to do this several times during the rolling process. If the dough gets too soft and squishy while you are rolling transfer it to a baking sheet (still between the parchment paper) and refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes until cool but flexible.   Peel off the top sheet of parchment. If the dough is soft and sticky refrigerate for 15 minutes. Using the cookie cutters press down firmly to cut out the shapes. Cut them as close together as possible. Using a small offset spatula lift the shapes off the parchment paper and transfer to the prepared pans spacing them about 1 inch apart. Press all the dough scraps together roll the dough out and cut out more shapes.  Place 1 baking sheet on each oven rack. Bake for 8 minutes then using oven mitts switch the pans between the oven racks. Bake for another 5 to 9 minutes until the cookies are golden brown around the edges and lightly golden in the center. Using oven mitts transfer the pans to the cooling racks and let the cookies cool completely before decorating. You may need to reuse the pans to finish baking all the cookies. Let the pans cool before you put more dough on them for baking.  Make the icing. Sift the powdered sugar into another medium bowl. Put the meringue powder and water in a large bowl. Make sure the bowl and your mixer beaters are very clean so the icing will whip up nicely. Beat the meringue on medium speed for about 1 minute then turn the mixer to high and continue to whip until the mixture looks like whipped cream and has formed soft peaks.   With the mixer on medium speed add the sifted sugar about  3/4 cup at a time shaking it gently over the bowl and letting it blend in slowly. Once all the s

Replace the usual canned tuna with grilled fresh ahi open a bottle of chilled rosé and toast the farmers whose hard work enables this feast.  To make the anchovy vinaigrette in a small bowl whisk together the olive oil vinegar anchovies garlic capers tarragon and fish sauce. Season to taste with salt.  Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F. If the beet greens are attached remove all but  1/2 inch of the stem. Reserve the greens and stems for another use. Put the beets in a large baking dish and add water to a depth of  3/4 inch. Cover and bake until a knife pierces them easily 45 minutes or longer depending on their size. When cool enough to handle peel the beets and cut into wedges.  Put the potatoes in a large pot and add salted water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender when pierced 15 to 20 minutes.

Classic Croissants,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Classic Croissants,24 croissants,  Dough Block (Detrempe):  1/2 cup (4 ounces) warm whole milk (110&deg; to 115&deg;F) 1 teaspoon plus 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) sugar 4 teaspoons active dry yeast or 1 tablespoon instant yeast 4 cups (20 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons salt  1/2 stick (2 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into small pieces 1 cup (8 ounces) cold milk   Butter Block (Beurrage): 3 1/2 sticks (14 ounces) cold unsalted butter 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unbleached all-purpose flour 1 large egg 1 tablespoon whole milk or cream   , Make the dough block:  Pour the warm milk into a small bowl and whisk in 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Whisk in the yeast and set aside for 10 minutes.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment combine the flour remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar the salt and cold butter pieces until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Add the yeast mixture and the cold milk. Switch to the dough hook and mix on lowest speed for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Knead the dough 3 to 5 times. Refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes. Make the butter block:  Cut the butter into  1/2-inch pieces toss with the flour and refrigerate for 20 minutes. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the floured butter on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes until the butter and flour form a smooth mass. Scrape the butter onto a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap and refrigerate while you roll out the dough. Incorporate the butter into the dough: Dust the work surface with flour. Set the dough in the center. Roll the dough into a 15 by 12-inch rectangle with a short side parallel to the edge of your work surface. Spread the cold but pliable butter evenly over the top two sections of dough leaving the bottom third empty and leaving a  1/2-inch border around the edges of the buttered sections.   Use a letter fold to encase the butter:  Fold the empty bottom third up over the center third of the dough. Then fold the top third down over the center. Refrigerate for 1 hour before continuing with the second turn.   Dust the dough with flour and roll it into a 20 by 12-inch rectangle. Fold the dough using the book-fold method: Fold the two short edges into the center of the dough leaving a  3/4-inch crevice between them. Now fold one side over the other as though you were closing a book. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator dust with flour and roll again into a 20 by 12-inch rectangle. Fold the dough using the letter-fold method: Visually divide the dough lengthwise into 3 equal 5-inchwide sections. Fold the bottom third up over the center of the dough and then fold the top third down over the center. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.  Cut the dough:  Roll the dough on a floured surface into a 26 by 14 by  3/4-inchthick rectangle. Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise to form two pieces that each measure 26 by 7 inches. On each piece use a ruler and paring knife to make nicks along the top edge of the dough every 4 inches. Along the bottom edge measure 2 inches in from the left side and make a nick; then add a nick every 4 inches.  Now cut the dough into triangles:  Line up your ruler with the top left corner and the first bottom nick. Cut along this line. Next line up the ruler with the first nick on the top edge and the left corner bottom and cut along that line Then cut a line from the first nick on top to the first nick on the bottom to form the second triangle. Continue cutting until the whole sheet.  Shape the dough:  Line the baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Make a 1-inch vertical slit in the center of the bottom edge of each triangle. Now roll the entire triangle toward the tip.   Wash with egg and proof:  In a small bowl lightly beat the eggs and milk. Brush each croissant evenly with the egg wash. Allow the croissants to rise until they are nearly doubled in size 1 to 2 hours.   Bake the croissants:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and position a rack in the center. Chill the croissants in the freezer for 10 minutes or in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Brush the croissants once more with the egg wash. Bake one baking sheet at a time rotating it halfway through for 17 to 22 minutes until the croissants are a deep golden brown. Transfer the croissants to a rack to cool.

Carrot Soup with Lemongrass,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/soups-stews/vegetarian/Carrot Soup with Lemongrass,6 to 8 servings,  3 lemongrass stalks 3 tablespoons unsalted butter  3/4 cup thinly sliced shallots 2 pounds carrots peeled and sliced  1/2-inch thick 1 1/2 quarts chicken or vegetable broth (if canned use equal parts broth and water) plus more if needed Kosher or sea salt Thinly sliced fresh chives for garnish   , With an aroma that fuses lemon ginger and mint lemongrass lurks in the background here. Tasters may not identify the fragrance but they know the carrots are getting an assist. Because the carrot flavor is delicate make sure your broth is not too intense. A tip from Vicki Westerhoff of Genesis Growers: “When our carrots are coming in fresh with awesome greens I always make carrot top soup. You can also use the greens sparingly in juicing and in salads.  To trim the lemongrass cut off the fibrous leafy tops and the hard base from each stalk. Cut the trimmed stalks into 3-inch lengths. With the side of a cleaver or a rolling pin smash the stalks firmly enough to break the fibers.  Melt the butter in a large pot over moderate heat. Add the shallots and sautŽ until softened about 3 minutes. Add the carrots broth and 6 pieces of the lemongrass and bring to a simmer. Taste and add more lemongrass if you don't perceive a subtle lemony-gingery taste. When you are satisfied that you have added enough lemongrass partially cover the pot and simmer gently until the carrots are cooked about 25 minutes.  Remove the lemongrass pieces with tongs and let the soup cool slightly. Puree in a blender or food processor until smooth in batches in necessary. Return the soup to a large clean pot and thin if desired with more broth or with water. Season with salt. Reheat to serve and divide among warmed soup bowls. Garnish each portion with the chives.

In this recipe it is made into a velvety concoction that makes an elegant first course for any dinner and is good cold as well as hot. I garnish the dish with herbs and roasted pistachio nuts although you can substitute slivered almonds. Buy peeled butternut squash if you find it at your market it is well worth the extra money because it is difficult to peel.  Put the squash onions leek olive oil salt pepper stock and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil cover partially reduce the heat to low and boil gently for 20 minutes. Emulsify with an immersion blender until smooth. You can use a regular blender or food processor but an immersion blender is more convenient. (The soup can be prepared to this point a day ahead covered and refrigerated. It also freezes well.)  At serving time add the cream and bring the soup to a boil. Serve garnished with a sprinkling of crushed pistachios and a sprig of fresh chervil or dill or a sprinkling of tarragon or chives.

Pale button mushrooms yield a prettier soup than the dark-skinned crimini mushrooms. To splurge top the soup with a few drops of truffle oil.  Melt the butter in a large pot over moderate heat. Add the leeks and saute until softened about 4 minutes. Add the celery root mushrooms potatoes thyme and broth and bring to a simmer. Cover and adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the vegetables are tender about 20 minutes.  Remove the thyme sprigs. Let cool slightly then puree the soup in a blender or food processor until smooth in batches if necessary. Return the soup to a clean pot and reheat to serve thinning to the desired consistency with additional broth. Season with salt and pepper.

Use a large heavy chef’s knife to cut the squash into big chunks. Because the skin is too thick and brittle to peel the squash is cooked and then the flesh is scooped from the skin. Pureed with coconut milk it makes a rich golden soup. Balance the richness with a generous addition of fresh lime juice slivered chiles and a shower of finely chopped cilantro.   Place the squash in a steamer insert set over a large pot of gently boiling water. Cover and cook for 20 minutes or until tender when pierced with a fork. Lift the steamer from over the water using an oven mitt and let the squash cool. Discard the water in the pot and wipe the pot dry.  Add the oil to the pot place over medium heat and heat the oil until hot enough to sizzle a piece of onion. Add the onion and cook over low heat stirring with a wooden spoon for 3 minutes or until the onion is translucent. Stir in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the cumin and cook stirring for 1 minute. Remove from the heat.  Use a tablespoon to scoop the cooled squash from the brittle skins and add it to the pot with the onion. Stir in the coconut milk.  Use immersion blender to puree the soup right in the pot. Alternatively puree soup in batches in a blender. Add the salt and pepper.  Reheat the soup over medium-low heat stirring to prevent sticking until steaming. Do not allow to boil. Stir in the lime juice half of the chile and 1 tablespoon of the cilantro. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt. Ladle into warmed bowls. Garnish with the remaining chile and the remaining tablespoon of cilantro.

Stuffed Artichokes with Pine Nuts and Currants,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Stuffed Artichokes with Pine Nuts and Currants,4 servings,  3 tablespoons dried currants  1/2 cup hot water 2 lemons 4 large artichokes 4 cups plain focaccia crumbs from about  1/2 pound day-old focaccia  1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino cheese 2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 large plum (Roma type) tomato grated  2 cloves garlic minced  3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil  3/4 cup pine nuts toasted  Scant 1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt Freshly ground black pepper   , With their leaves spread to embrace the filling these hefty artichokes resemble pompom chrysanthemums - a reminder that they are in fact flower buds. Stuffed with garlicky focaccia crumbs a single one makes a satisfying lunch.  Put the currants in a small bowl add the hot water and let soften for 20 minutes. Drain.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Fill a large bowl with cold water and add the juice of 1 lemon. Cut the other lemon in half.  Working with 1 artichoke at a time cut off the stem flush with the base. Rub the base with a lemon half to prevent browning. With a serrated knife slice off the top 1 inch of the artichoke; rub the exposed surface with lemon. With scissors snip off the pointed tips of the remaining leaves. With your fingers carefully pry open the center of the artichoke to reveal the pale prickly inner leaves and fuzzy choke taking care not to break any leaves. Pull out the innermost prickly leaves then use a small spoon or melon baller to scrape the hairy choke from the artichoke bottom. Squeeze some lemon juice into the cavity and drop the trimmed artichoke into the lemon water. If necessary invert a plate over the artichoke to keep it submerged. Repeat with the remaining artichokes.  In a large bowl combine the focaccia crumbs cheese parsley and dried oregano crumbling the dried herb between your fingers. Add the tomato garlic olive oil pine nuts currants salt and several grinds of pepper. Mix well with our hands. Measure the volume of the filling so that you can put one-quarter of the volume in each artichoke.  Remove the artichokes from the lemon water and invert on paper towels briefly to drain excess water. With your fingers fill the center cavities with some of the stuffing then tuck more stuffing between the leaves. The inner leaves are too close together to separate without breaking them but pack stuffing between leaves where you can.  Set a rack inside a deep baking dish large enough to hold the artichokes. Stand the artichokes upright on the rack then add boiling water to a depth of ½ inch to the dish. Cover the artichokes with a sheet of parchment paper then cover the baking dish tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.  Bake until you can pull a leaf out easily 1 to 1 3/4 hours. Taste the leaf and make sure the base is tender. Let cool for at least 20 minutes before serving. The artichokes are best when warm not hot.

We have added a teaspoon of mascarpone to the recipe to provide creaminess and a little tang to the dish.    Pour the vegetable or chicken broth into a large saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. When boiling lower the heat to low cover the saucepan and keep the liquid hot. In case additional liquid is required fill an additional small saucepan with water and place on the stove over a high heat until boiling. Once boiling lower heat cover and keep hot.    In another large heavy bottom saucepan heat olive oil and butter over medium-high heat until the butter foams. When foaming subsides add leeks and cook stirring occasionally until translucent about 10 minutes. Add rice and stir until begins to turn opaque about 2 minutes.    Add the wine and cook stirring frequently with a wooden spoon until all the wine has been absorbed.    Once the liquid has been absorbed increase heat to medium and using a ladle add about 1 cup of hot broth to the rice. Cook stirring constantly with a wooden spoon over medium heat until broth is almost fully absorbed. Add the remaining stock  1/2 cup at a time stirring constantly and adding more broth only after the previous addition has been absorbed until the rice begins to pull away from the sides of the pan about 16 to 20 minutes.    Throughout the cooking process adjust the so the rice simmers rapidly without boiling. Use boiling water if stock has been used and rice requires more cooking time. The risotto is done when it is creamy and the grains are plump and tender with a slight resistance to the bite. When the risotto is cooked stir in the lemon zest and smoked trout.     Taste and season with salt and pepper.    To serve:  Ladle risotto into 4 warmed shallow serving bowls place a teaspoon of mascarpone on the top sprinkle with chervil and serve immediately.

Homemade Spicy Italian Breakfast Sausage,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Homemade Spicy Italian Breakfast Sausage,16 patties,  3 pounds pork butt 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons sea salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh oregano 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 2 teaspoons chile flakes 2 tablespoons toasted fennel seeds 1 tablespoon paprika sweet not smoked 1 cup very cold red wine 1 tablespoon vegetable oil plus more for testing   , Nothing beats sausage that you make yourself! The basic ratio for sausage is 3 parts meat to 1 part fat. We like to use pork butt because it has great ratio. If you find your pork is a bit lean you can purchase pork fat back to enrich your mixture. The spice level is medium in this recipe add more chile flakes if you like a little more fire. If you don't have a meat grinder substitute ground pork or ask your local butcher for a custom grind.  Cut the meat into 1-inch cubes and place them in a 9- x 13-inch baking dish. Toss the meat together with the sugar salt and pepper until well combined and transfer the baking dish to the freezer until well chilled but not frozen about 1 hour. Place the grinder parts blades course die and bowl of the stand mixer you'll be using into the freezer too. Keeping everything well-chilled will ensure a successful sausage outcome.   Grind the meat mixture into the bowl of the stand mixer and attach the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Using the lowest setting mix in the oregano garlic and spices until evenly combined. Slowly add the cold wine to the mixture and mix until the liquid is incorporated and the mixture looks sticky 1 to 2 minutes.   Take a small spoonful of the sausage and fry it in a small skillet with a little oil until cooked through. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt if necessary.   Using wet hands form the meat into 3-inch patties (about  1/2-inch thick).   Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. When the oil is shimmering add the sausage patties and fry on both sides until golden brown and cooked through 8 to 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and serve immediately.

Position Wolf Gourmet oven rack to middle position. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F in ROAST with convection.   Cut tenderloin in half. Rub each piece with olive oil. Place the tenderloin pieces on the roasting rack inside the baking pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Insert the temperature probe in thickest part of tenderloin and set to 125 degrees F for rare. When oven chimes tenderloin temperature has been reached remove from oven and tent with aluminum foil.   Allow the meat to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.  Tip: To achieve best results for the thinner end of the tenderloin place the thinner piece in the front of the roasting rack and insert the probe in this piece. When the temperature is reached remove the smaller piece from the pan and place on a cutting board to rest. Insert the probe into the thicker piece and continue roasting until the desired temperature is reached for that piece. 
Braided Challah,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Braided Challah,ded loaves,  1 recipe Challah Dough here» 1 egg yolk 1 egg 2 tablespoons whole milk  Optional toppings: 1 tablespoon poppy seeds 1 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 tablespoon flaky sea salt 2 tablespoons pearl sugar   , This bread is wonderful straight out of the oven with butter and salt but it gets even better the next day. Try day old challah as a base to bread pudding or as a decadent French toast.   To shape the dough:  If working with dough from the refrigerator remove the dough about 1 hour before you plan to shape and allow to come to room temperature. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and cut it 6 pieces making sure all the pieces are the same weight. Flatten each piece with your hand then roll the pieces into a cigar or torpedo shape. After doing this with each piece return to the first one and roll it out into a rope 10 to 14 inches long. (The bigger the piece of dough the longer the rope.) Make sure each rope is the same length.   To shape a 3-braid loaf lay 3 equal strands side by side parallel to one another. Beginning in the middle of the loaf overlap one of the outside strands over the middle strand then take the opposite outside strand and cross it over the new middle strand. Continue this pattern until you get to the ends of the strands then pinch the tips together to seal. Rotate the loaf so the unbraided side is facing you then repeat the pattern on that end.  To shape a 6-braid loaf connect 6 strands of equal weight and length at one end spreading the other ends out with the tips facing you. From the left number the strands 1 through 6 and bring strand 6 over strand 1 to build up the end of the loaf. Strand 5 has now become the new strand 6 and the old strand 6 is now strand 1. Now follow this pattern: 2 over 6 1 over 3 5 over 1 and 6 over 4. Repeat the pattern until you get to the ends of the strands then pinch the tips together to seal.  Transfer the loaves to a parchment lined sheet pan.  To a small bowl whisk together the egg yolk and milk.  Using a pastry brush brush the entire surface of the loaves with egg wash.  Cover the loaves with lightly greased plastic wrap and allow to double in size about 30 minutes to 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Egg wash the loaves a second time make sure to get the egg wash inside the creases of the braid and sprinkle with toppings if using.  Bake for about 20 minutes then rotate the pan and bake for another 15 to 30 minutes until the loaves sound hollow when thumped on the bottom and the internal temperature is about 190 degrees F (88 degrees C) in the center. Cool on a wire rack for at least 45 minutes before slicing or serving.  
Steak with Mustard Butter and French Fries,David Lebovitz,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Steak with Mustard Butter and French Fries,2 servings,  2 (8-ounce/225g) rib-eye steaks  1/2 teaspoon hickory-smoked salt sea salt or kosher salt  3/4 to  1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh cilantro or flat-leaf parsley Vegetable oil or clarified butter (page 327)  Freshly ground black pepper  Mustard Butter: 2 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature 2 teaspoons dry mustard or mustard powder 1 generous teaspoon Dijon mustard French fries (page 219)    , "To make this bistro classic in my kitchen I use a cast-iron skillet or grill pan that I get really hot and then I sear the steak on both sides cooking it medium-rare which is the way I like it. My preferred cut is entrecôte or rib-eye and I ask the butcher to cut it into steaks that aren't too thick since I like lots of surface area on my steaks. I rub them with chipotle chile powder to give them a bit of a smoky flavor.  It's difficult to say exactly how long it will take a particular steak to cook to your liking since there are so many variables but there is actually no truth to the rumor that if you cut a steak open a little and peek inside all the juices will come gushing out and your steak will be dry. In fact the best way to ensure a steak is dry is to overcook it. So feel free to peek inside if you need to." &#8211Reprinted with permission from My Paris Kitchen by David Lebovitz copyright &#169; 2014. Published by Ten Speed Press an imprint of Random House LLC.  Pat the steaks dry and rub them with the salt chipotle powder and cilantro. Refrigerate the steaks uncovered for at least 1 hour or up to 8 hours.  To make the mustard butter in a small bowl mash together the butter with the dry mustard and the Dijon. Form it into two mounds and chill on a plastic wrap–lined plate.  Heat a little oil or clarified butter in a grill pan or cast-iron skillet and cook the steaks over high heat being sure to get a good sear on each side. For rare steaks cook 5 to 7 minutes total on both sides or aller-retour ("to go and return").  Remove the steaks from the pan and put on plates. Top each steak with a knob of the mustard butter and some pepper and serve with a big pile of frites.   
Grilled Shrimp and Avocado Salad,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/salads/meat-poultry-seafood/Grilled Shrimp and Avocado Salad,4 servings,  1 pound large shrimp peeled and deveined  3 large ears of corn husked 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil divided plus more as needed   1/2 teaspoon good quality chile powder  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper  2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice plus more to taste  2 tablespoons fresh chopped dill  2 ripe avocadoes pitted and sliced 2 cups salad greens such as mache or watercress picked washed and dried  4 cups baby romaine or bibb lettuce cut washed and dried  High quality finishing salt such as alder smoked or truffle salt   , This easy to put to together salad is approachable and sophisticated enough for any summer meal or event.

Sky High Mushroom-Pancetta  Quiche with Caramelized Shallots and Sage,Thyme & Temp,home/recipes/breakfast/egg-dishes/Sky High Mushroom-Pancetta  Quiche with Caramelized Shallots and Sage,8 servings,  Crust (makes 2 crusts): 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter well chilled  1/3 cup vegetable shortening well chilled 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon sugar  1/2 cup iced water 1 tbsp chilled vodka  Filling: 4 oz pancetta diced (3 slices of thick-cut bacon would work as well)  1 tbsp butter 3 shallots sliced (makes 1 cup)  1 lb oyster mushrooms 8 oz baby bella mushrooms sliced 1 tbsp fresh sage chopped 1 tsp fresh thyme Salt and pepper to taste 1 cup fresh arugula 6 eggs 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 1/2 cups whole milk 1 3/4 tsp salt 1 tsp pepper 1 tsp smoked paprika 1 cup gruyere cheese   , Make the Crust: Cube butter and shortening and chill in the freezer for 10 minutes.  In the bowl of a food processor combine 2 cups of the flour salt and sugar. Pulse briefly two times. Remove butter and shortening from the freezer and add to the bowl of the food processor. Pulse 6 to 8 times being careful not to over-process the dough. There should be big chunks of butter visible in the dough.   Pour the butter/flour mixture into a large mixing bowl and use a rubber spatula to stir in the remaining 1 cup of flour. Sprinkle the vodka and about three tablespoons of ice water to start over the mixture and mix it up with the rubber spatula. If necessary add more ice water. You don't want the dough to be wet but you don't want any loose powdery flour in the bowl either.  Knead the dough gently once or twice and divide into two balls. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.  Par Bake the Crust: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Prepare an 8 or 9 inch spring-form pan with butter. Placing the dough between two sheets of parchment paper roll out dough to 15-16 inches so there will be enough over-hang once it's placed in the spring-form pan. Once rolled to the suggested size gently place the dough still between the parchment in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to chill. Once chilled remove the top layer of parchment and gently roll the dough on to your rolling pin and transfer to the spring-form pan.  Delicately line the pan with your fingers using any leftover dough to fill holes or tears.  Leave about two inches of over-hang to press along the edge-it can be trimmed when you're finished and removing from the pan. Line the dough with foil or parchment and fill with pie weights dried beans or rice. We used a combo of all three since this was so deep that our pie weights could only fill half. (Discard the beans or rice once par baked. They've been cooked!) Place in the oven and bake for 40 minutes. Once completed remove the weights and bake the crust for an additional 15 minutes or until just lightly browned.  Prepare the filling during this baking process. Make the Filling and Bake: In a cold sauté pan add pancetta and bring heat to a medium low allowing it render and cook to almost crisp about 8 minutes. Remove and set aside on a paper towel. Do not discard the oil that's been rendered. Increase heat to medium and add butter to the oil left in the pan. Add the shallots and stir frequently until caramelized about 12 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside with pancetta. Add olive oil and mushrooms to sauté pan and cook mushrooms until soft about 12 minutes.  Turn off heat and combine mushrooms with pancetta shallots herbs arugula and salt and pepper to taste. Layer the bottom of the par baked crust with half of the cheese and then half of the mushroom filling. In a large mixing bowl whisk together the eggs dairy and seasoning until frothy. Pour custard about  3/4 of the way up the shell and add remaining filling top with cheese and place in the oven.  Bake at 325 degrees F for about 1 hour 15 minutes.  The top should be golden brown in spots and mostly firm when tapped with just the slightest jiggle at the very middle of the quiche.  Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 15 minutes.  When cooled you can choose to break off the overhang of the crust or leave as-is before releasing the spring-form and removing from the bottom-up.

Lemon-Herb Cod with Crispy Garlic Potatoes,One-Pan Wonders,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Lemon-Herb Cod with Crispy Garlic Potatoes,4 servings,  1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes unpeeled sliced into  3/4-inch thick rounds 2 tablespoons unsalted butter melted plus 3 tablespoons cut into  3/4-inch pieces 3 garlic cloves minced 4 sprigs fresh thyme plus 1 teaspoon minced Salt and pepper 4 (6- to 8-ounce) skinless cod fillets 1- to 1 1/2-inches thick 1 lemon thinly sliced   ,  Easy but elegant this unconventional take on classic roasted cod and potatoes ensures moist flaky fish and browned flavorful potatoes. Seeking to avoid overcooking the fish we used our russet potatoes as a bed to shield them from the direct heat of the pan. Rather than just pile them onto the pan we thinly sliced the potatoes; tossed them with melted butter garlic and thyme for plenty of flavor; and shingled them in four individual portions for an attractive presentation.  After shaping our potato rectangles we roasted them for 30 minutes which gave the spuds a crisp browned exterior and removed excess moisture. We then laid a cod fillet on top of each. To highlight the fish's clean flavor and keep things easy we topped each fillet with a small pat of butter a sprig of fresh thyme and a couple thin slices of lemon (which would add to the appealing look of the dish). We slid our pan back into the oven where the dry heat melted the butter basting the fish and drawing the herbal and citrus flavors through the fillets and down over the potatoes. After another 15 minutes this simple yet striking dish was ready to serve. You can substitute skinless haddock or halibut for the cod.  Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees F . Toss potatoes with melted butter garlic minced thyme  1/2 teaspoon salt and  3/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl. Shingle potatoes into four 6 by 4‑inch rectangular piles on rimmed baking sheet.  Roast until spotty brown and just tender 30 to 35 minutes rotating sheet halfway through roasting.  Pat cod dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Lay 1 cod fillet skinned side down on top of each potato pile and top with butter pieces thyme sprigs and lemon slices. Bake until cod flakes apart when gently prodded with paring knife and registers 140 degrees F about 15 minutes.  Remove sheet from oven. Slide spatula underneath potatoes and cod and gently transfer to individual plates. Serve.

Spicy Red Lentil Soup with Mustard Greens and Butternut Squash,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/soups-stews/grains-legumes-pasta/Spicy Red Lentil Soup with Mustard Greens and Butternut Squash,8 servings,  2 tablespoons canola oil 1 medium yellow onion minced 4 cloves garlic minced 1-inch piece fresh ginger peeled and minced 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon cumin seed toasted and finely ground 1 dried red chile broken in half 2 cups Indian red lentils rinsed 1 bay leaf 1 quart chicken or vegetable broth (if canned use equal parts broth and water) 1 quart water Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups peeled butternut or kabocha squash in  1/2-inch dice  1/3 pound mustard greens ribs removed and cut crosswise into  1/2-inch-wide ribbons   , Despite their name red lentils are coral and they turn yellow when cooked. Here they are simmered with fragrant Indian spices until they collapse into puree. Nuggets of pumpkin-colored squash and forest green ribbons of mustard greens are stirred in to complete the soup. Look for the lentils in Indian markets. Brown lentils are not a good substitute as they don’t break down as readily as the red lentils do.  Heat the canola oil in a large pot over moderate heat. Add the onion garlic ginger turmeric cumin and chile and saute until the onion is soft about 10 minutes. Add the lentils bay leaf broth and water and bring to a simmer skimming any surface foam. Cover and adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the lentils are soft about 30 minutes.  Season the lentils with salt and pepper. Stir in the squash. Cover and simmer until the squash is almost tender but still slightly firm about 8 minutes. Stir in the mustard greens re-cover and remove the soup from the heat. Let stand until the mustard greens soften and the squash is fully cooked 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove the bay leaf and chile. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Divide the soup among warmed bowls. Serve immediately.   
Spicy Pinto Bean Soup,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/soups-stews/grains-legumes-pasta/Spicy Pinto Bean Soup,6 servings,  2 tablespoons lard olive oil or vegetable oil 1 large yellow onion quartered and thinly sliced Kosher salt and ground black pepper 4 garlic cloves thinly sliced 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 teaspoon dried oregano 4 chipotle chilies in adobo chopped plus 1 tablespoon adobo 1 quart low-sodium chicken broth or water 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1 pound pinto beans rinsed and soaked overnight (see note)   1/2 cup minced fresh cilantro leaves 3 tablespoons lime juice   ,  Though we loved the rich flavor lard gave to the beans olive or vegetable oil worked too. Serve this soup with shredded cheese sliced scallions and plenty of hot sauce. Start timing the soup once it has reached high pressure.

The bacon cooks onto the potatoes providing additional flavor and richness. Sprinkle with finishing salts and freshly ground black pepper.   Place a pizza stone in the lower third of your oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Allow the pizza stone to preheat for at least 30 minutes.   Make the dough:   Place flour sugar salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds to combine. With mixer running on low speed add water and olive oil and mix for 1 minute to combine. Increase speed to medium and process until dough forms a slightly sticky ball about 1 to 2 minutes. If ball does not form add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time and continue mixing until ball forms. Coat a large mixing bowl with a thin film of olive oil. Transfer dough ball to prepared mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest until doubled in volume about 1- 1/2 to 2 hours.   When dough is ready press it gently to remove air bubbles and turn out on a lightly floured work surface. Using a bench scraper divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a tight ball cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for 15 minutes before baking.  Once your stone is preheated you can start rolling out your dough. Dust work surface with flour. Flatten one dough ball to a thickness of  1/2 inch and roll to a diameter of about 5 inches keeping the remaining dough covered. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with another piece of parchment. Continue rolling dough balls and placing on the baking sheet separating layers of rolled dough with additional sheets of parchment as needed. Cover stack of dough rounds with plastic wrap and set aside.  To make the pizza: In a large mixing bowl combine the potatoes onion bacon and rosemary leaves. Add olive oil salt and pepper and toss until well coated.  Sprinkle a pizza peel with some cornmeal or flour and place a dough round on the peel. Give the peel a little shake to make sure that the dough moves freely and is not sticking. Arrange the potato onions bacon and rosemary mixture over the pizza dough. Sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.   Open the oven and slide the pizza off of the peel onto the pizza stone. Allow pizza to cook until you have reached your desired crust.   Remove the pizza from the oven and place on a cutting board. Allow the pizza to rest for 1 to 2 minutes before you cut and serve it.   Tips for Using a Pizza Stone   Before its first use wash the stone with water. Never use detergent.  Place the stone in a cold oven and preheat the oven. Typically pizza is baked at the maximum oven temperature between 500 to 550-degrees. Store the stone on the lowest rack of the oven so it's always handy for baking pizza or bread. Do not use the stone to bake breads with high-fat content because the fat will stain the porous stone.   Tips for Using a Pizza Peel   To prevent sticking sprinkle the peel with flour cornmeal or semolina before sliding it under the uncooked pizza crust or loaf of bread.  Place the pizza-shaped dough on the peel and then add the toppings.  Reach the peel into the oven and angle it downward. Shake it gently until the pizza slowly slides off the peel onto the stone. To retrieve the finished pizza slide the peel under the crust and guide it onto the peel.

Fried Fish Bones & Smoked Fish,Recipe courtesy of Scraps,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Fried Fish Bones & Smoked Fish,4 servings  Learn more about Scraps ,  2 cups neutral oil plus more for drizzling 4 whole rainbow trout cleaned filets and bones separated Coarse kosher salt or your favorite seasoning blend  1/2 lemon zested and juiced Special equipment: Applewood BBQ smoking chips charcoal charcoal grill   , Fry the fish bones: Pour oil into a large cast iron pan and heat on medium high until it reaches around 375 degrees F. Fry fish bones until golden brown and crispy about 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel.  Sprinkle with salt lemon zest and squeeze of lemon juice. You may cut bones into smaller pieces before serving.    Prepare your charcoal grill: Add charcoal to grill and allow for 30 minutes to 1 hour for the charcoal to burn down to white coals.  While your grill is heating up make sure to scrub the grates with a stainless steel brush to clean off and leftover food.   Lightly coat flesh side of the fish with oil and sprinkle with salt.    Remove the grate from the grill and bank the charcoal to one side. This will create two heating zones in the grill direct heat and indirect heat. Scatter two large handfuls of wood chips on top of coals and place the grate back on. The wood chips should immediately start to burn and produce a flame but this flame will die down and quickly turn to smoke.    Working quickly place trout flesh side down on the opposite side of the charcoal (the indirect heat zone). Cover with the lid and allow to smoke for 6 - 7 minutes.    Depending on the size of your grill you may have to smoke in batches adding another handful of wood chips as needed for each batch.   Notes:   What's left: Spent lemon.  There are many methods to smoking at home on a charcoal grill. Wood chips versus wood chunks. Soaking wood versus not soaking wood. Closing the vent versus keeping it open for circulation. Adding a drip pan or water pan to regulate temperature. The technique used in this recipe was preferred because it was the simplest method easy to follow almost foolproof and yielded delicious smoked trout in less than 7 minutes. This is one impressive recipe even the grill novice can master.   You can smoke any type of fish you want but this method of using dry wood chips scattered on top of hot charcoal works best with thinner filets because the wood chips burn out quickly. The thicker the fish the longer it will take to smoke which means you may have to soak your wood chips for at least 30 minutes to prevent them from burning out to quickly. Ideally you want to smoke to last the entire cooking time.

King Arthur Flour's No-Knead Crusty White Bread,King Arthur Flour Company Inc.,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/King Arthur Flour's No-Knead Crusty White Bread,3 to 4 loaves,  3 cups lukewarm water 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 cups Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 1/2 tbsp. instant yeast  3/4 cup milk for brushing    , The most basic of all no-knead loaves this is a wonderful way to get into yeast-bread baking. The easy stir-together dough rests in your refrigerator developing flavor all the time till you're ready to bake. About 90 minutes before you want to serve bread grab a handful of dough shape it let it rise then bake for 30 minutes. The result? Incredible crusty artisan-style bread. If you're a first-time bread baker you'll never believe this bread came out of your own oven. If you're a seasoned yeastie you'll love this recipe's simplicity.  The flour/liquid ratio is important in this recipe. If you measure flour by sprinkling it into your measuring cup then gently sweeping off the excess use 7 1/2 cups. If you measure flour by dipping your cup into the canister then use 6 1/2 cups. Most accurate of all and guaranteed to give you the best results if you measure flour by weight use 32 ounces.  Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl or a large (6-quart) food-safe plastic bucket. For first timers "lukewarm" means about 105 degrees but don't stress over getting the temperatures exact here. Comfortably warm is fine. "OUCH that is hot!" is not. Yeast is a living thing treat it nicely.  Mix and stir everything together to make a very sticky rough dough. If you have a stand mixer beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60 seconds. If you don't have a mixer just stir-stir-stir with a wooden spoon or dough whisk until everything is combined.  Next you're going to let the dough rise. If you've made the dough in a plastic bucket you're all set-just let it stay there covering the bucket with a lid or plastic wrap; a shower cap actually works well here. Transfer the dough to a large bowl as it will rise significantly. There is no need to grease the bowl though you can if you like; it makes it a bit easier to get the dough out when it's time to bake the bread.  Cover the bowl and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours or for up to about 7 days. (If you are pressed for time skip the room temperature rise and stick it right into the fridge.) The longer you keep the dough in the fridge the tangier it'll get; if you chill it for 7 days it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so it'll rise and then fall. That's OK; that's what it's supposed to do.  When you're ready to make the bread sprinkle the top of the dough with flour; this will make it easier to grab a hunk. Grease your hands and pull off about  3/4 to  1/3 of the dough-a 14-ounce to 19-ounce piece if you have a scale. It'll be about the size of a softball or a large grapefruit.  Plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface and round it into a ball or a longer log. Don't fuss around trying to make it perfect; just do the best you can.  Place the dough on  a piece of parchment (if you're going to use a baking stone); or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top; this will help keep the dough moist as it rests before baking.  Let the dough rise for about 45 to 60 minutes. It won't appear to rise upwards that much; rather it'll seem to settle and expand. Preheat your oven (and baking stone if you're using one) to 450 degrees while the dough rests. Place a shallow metal or cast iron pan (not glass Pyrex or ceramic) on the lowest rack and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go.  If you are using a bread cloche do not pre-heat your oven and skip to the method below.  When you're ready to bake take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times making a cut about  1/2" deep. The bread may deflate a bit; that's O

We use fresh strawberries in the spring but feel free to use any seasonal berry such as raspberries and blackberries.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position the rack in the center. Lightly butter the bottoms and sides of 2 (9-inch) round cake pans. Dust pans with flour and shake out the excess.  To prepare the cake: Place all the ingredients except the milk in the food processor and process into a thick batter. Add milk and pulse until the batter is smooth. Divide the batter between the prepared pans and bake for 20 minutes or until the cakes are springy to the touch and a cake tester comes out clean. Allow cakes to cool for 10 minutes before turning out on a wire rack to cool completely.   To assemble cake: Place jam in a medium skillet and warm it over medium heat to loosen the consistency. Remove from heat and fold in strawberries. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment add cream and sugar; whisk on medium speed until cream holds firm shiny peaks.   Transfer one of the cooled cakes to a cake plate. Spread the strawberries over the top of the cake. Top the berries with the whipped cream using a spatula and starting from the center of the cake and smoothing it out towards the edges. Place the second cake on top. Using a fine-mesh sieve dust the cake generously with confectioners' sugar and serve.     
Mushrooms with Garlic and Parsley,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/appetizers/vegetarian/Mushrooms with Garlic and Parsley,4 servings,   3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound white button or crimini mushrooms all about the same size cleaned and stems removed 5 garlic cloves peeled and thinly sliced 1 sprig fresh thyme  3/4 cup Manzanilla sherry Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley   , Serve these garlicky tapas solo or as a tasty accompaniment to grilled steak or burgers scrambled eggs or a toasted baguette.  Heat 6 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and leave them in the pan until they brown on one side about 1 minute.  Then shake the pan to turn the mushrooms over and brown again for another minute.  Repeat two or three times until the mushrooms are brown all over.  The mushrooms will release some water but don't worry: if your pan is hot enough the water will evaporate.  If the pan seems dry add the additional 2 tablespoons of oil.  Next add the garlic and thyme and stir until the garlic is light brown about 30 seconds.  Be careful not to burn the garlic.  Pour in the sherry and cook until it almost completely evaporates about 1 minute.  At this point the pan will contain a nice brown sauce of reduced sherry and mushroom juices.  Season with salt and pepper to taste sprinkle the parsley on top and serve immediately in the pan.

When the beef is tender use tongs to remove the tomato skins and thyme sprigs. Taste and season with salt and black pepper. Transfer the stew to a warmed serving bowl or plate and serve.    
Sous Vide Steak,Sansaire,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Sous Vide Steak,1 serving,  Steak 3 tablespoons soy sauce 3 tablespoons fish sauce 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon blue cheese  1/2 teaspoon anchovy paste   , Sous vide is ridiculously useful for barbecue and grilling situations. Because different meats take different times to cook and because nobody wants to under- or overcook their meats we always cook everything until done sous vide then slap it on a hot grill just to finish. The results are phenomenal. You get the same romanticism of traditional grilling but with vastly better results. Plus since all your food is cooked ahead of time and hanging out in a warm bath when people get hungry it only takes a few minutes to feed the crowd.  Mix ingredients to combine add to bag with steak. Follow guidance at Sansaire.com/steak for cooking temperature and time.  Recommend using flank steak skirt steak or tri-tip. For tri-tip (thick steaks) cook for 4 hours minimum up to 24 hours.   Finish over a super-hot grill.

Dutch Oven Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder with Rosemary Garlic Marinade,All-Clad & Chef Paul Kahan,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Dutch Oven Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder with Rosemary Garlic Marinade,4 servings,  3.5 pounds boneless pork shoulder (ask your local butcher to butterfly it so you can rub the center of the pork roast with the rosemary-garlic marinade and then tie it with kitchen twine)  Basic meat brine (see recipe)  Rosemary-garlic marinade (see recipe)  2 cups oven-roasted tomatoes (see recipe) or 14.5 ounce can of San Marzano tomatoes 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 medium onions large dice 4 carrots peeled and cut into large chunks 4 ribs of celery cut into large chunks 1 head of garlic cut in half to expose the cloves unpeeled 1 cup white wine 2 cups pork or chicken stock 1 sprig of rosemary 3 tablespoons Italian flat-leaf parsley chopped  Basic Meat Brine:   1 cup Kosher salt 1 cup sugar 1 gallon of water 1 head of garlic split in half lengthwise to expose the cloves 2 sprigs rosemary  Oven-Roasted Tomatoes:   8 vine-ripe or roma tomatoes cut in half 4 cloves garlic finely chopped 2 teaspoons herbs de Provence 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 3 tablespoons olive oil  Rosemary-Garlic Marinade:   1 head of garlic peeled 6 sprigs of rosemary leaves only 2 tablespoons picked thyme leaves 2 tablespoons red chili flakes 2 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 tablespoons fennel seeds 2 tablespoons black peppercorns 4 brown anchovy filets  1/2 cup of extra-virgin olive-oil   , A day of brining and a slow roast in rosemary and garlic produces this exceptionally fragrant tender and delicious pork dish by Chef and Restaurateur Paul Kahan.  Day 1: Brine the pork shoulder in Basic Meat Brine for 24 hours. Dissolve the salt and sugar in warm water allow to cool completely. Add the other ingredients. Weigh it down with a plate and cover. Refrigerate overnight.   Prepare the Rosemary-Garlic Marinade. In a blender or food processor combine all ingredients and blend into a paste. Cover and refrigerate overnight.   Oven-roast the tomatoes and store in the refrigerator. Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a mixing bowl add all ingredients to coat well. Place tomatoes on a cookie sheet skin-side down cut side up. Season with salt and pepper. Bake at 400 degrees until the tops are caramelized and tomatoes are tender. Once the tomatoes have cooled peel the skins off and discard. Chop the roasted tomatoes and store in the refrigerator.  Day 2: Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the pork shoulder from the brine. Pat it dry with a clean towel. Rub the pork with the Rosemary-Garlic Marinade. Tightly tie or truss it with kitchen twine. Add 2 tablespoons of canola oil into the bottom of the All-Clad Dutch Oven and then add the onions carrots celery and head of garlic. Place the pork shoulder onto the bed of vegetables. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven uncovered for 1 hour and 30 minutes at 375 degrees. After this time reduce the temperature down to 350 degrees and put the lid on.

Once the roast is cooked through set it onto a cutting board and allow it to rest. Set the Dutch oven over the stove top and turn the heat onto medium-high. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and allow it to reduce by half the amount of liquid. Add the oven-roasted tomatoes sprig of rosemary and then add the pork or chicken stock and bring to boil. Reduce the heat down to a simmer for 15 minutes.Season the pan sauce with salt and pepper. Carefully remove the butcher's twine and slice the pork shoulder. Serve on a warm platter with the pan sauce spooned over the meat.Garnish with the roasted vegetables and freshly chopped parsley.  
Classic Extra-Cheesy Macaroni and Cheese with Crunchy Crumb Topping,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Classic Extra-Cheesy Macaroni and Cheese with Crunchy Crumb Topping,4 to 6 servings,  5 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons unbleached allpurpose flour 2 1/2 cups whole or 2&#37; milk Coarse salt  3/4 teaspoon dry mustard (optional)  1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (optional)  1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 cups grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese  1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 pound elbow macaroni 1 cup coarse fresh bread crumbs   , Hurray for real mac and cheese. It’s crazy to eat the stuff from the box when the real deal is so easy to make and so totally superior. Do use a cheese with some character however or the bland noodles will dominate.  Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F. Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a medium heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth; cook 2 to 3 minutes whisking frequently. Slowly pour in the milk whisking vigorously. If the sauce gets lumpy don't worry; just keep whisking until smooth. Lower the heat and simmer for 7 to 8 minutes whisking frequently until creamy and smooth. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt the mustard and nutmeg if using and the black pepper.  Take the pan off the heat and add 2 1/2 cups of the Cheddar and half the Parmesan cheese. Whisk until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Taste and add more seasonings if you like. It should be salted well as the sauce will flavor the macaroni.  Meanwhile bring a large pot of water to a boil add 2 tablespoons salt and boil the macaroni according to the package directions. Drain well return to the pot then toss with the sauce until thoroughly coated. Pile into a 13 by 9-inch baking dish or four 6-inch cast-iron skillets. Sprinkle evenly with the remaining Cheddar and Parmesan.  Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and toss with the bread crumbs; distribute over the macaroni. Bake until the topping is browned and the macaroni is hot about 20 minutes. Let rest for about 10 minutes before serving.  Variations: While the classic is always welcome try mixing things up on occasion by adding zippy green chiles or briny tuna.   For a smoky green chile version add 1 drained 4-ounce can diced mild green chiles before you put the macaroni in the baking dish. Mix 1 teaspoon smoked paprika with the crumbs and butter.  For the "tuna melt" version substitute 1 cup grated Havarti or Fontina cheese for 1 cup of the Cheddar when you make the sauce (you'll still need a total of 3 cups cheese plus the  1/2 cup Parmesan). Add 2 drained 5-ounce cans tuna and 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest to the macaroni before you put it in the baking dish.   
Spice-Crusted Pork Chops with Orange-Chipotle Glaze,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Spice-Crusted Pork Chops with Orange-Chipotle Glaze,4 servings,  1 tablespoon cumin seeds 1 tablespoon freshly cracked coriander seeds 1 tablespoon dried chipotle chile I tablespoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 4 (5-ounce) pork chops bone-in center about 1 1/2-inch thick   3/4 cup orange juice  3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 clove garlic peeled and chopped  3/4 teaspoon cumin  1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile  1/2 teaspoon lemon juice  , The thickness of the chop combined with the orange-chipotle glaze will assist in preventing the chop from drying out while providing a delicious combination of flavors. Cooking meats that have been stored in the refrigerator should be brought to room temperature prior to cooking to prevent drying out the exterior of the meat before you've given the inside a chance to cook through.   To spice rub pork: In a small bowl combine cumin coriander chile salt and pepper. Use paper towels to pat-dry the pork chops and coat completely with spice mixture. Transfer to a plate and set aside until the pork is at room temperature.   To prepare glaze: In a small saucepan add the orange juice sugar and garlic and place on the stove over a medium-high heat to boil. When the liquid has come to a boil reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the sauce has thickened about 5 minutes. Add the cumin chile and lemon juice and stir thoroughly until well combined. Taste and season with salt and pepper.  To cook pork: Prepare a moderate charcoal fire for indirect grilling preheat a gas grill to medium leaving one burner unlit or heat a large grill pan over medium heat. Brush the grill grates or pan with a thin coating of oil using a silicone pastry brush.  Set the chops onto the grill and brown on both sides turning once for about 3 minutes per side. Using a silicone pastry brush apply a thin coating of glaze on both sides of the chops cover the grill and cook until the chops offer some resistance to the touch but are still springy not firm about 4 minutes longer. Alternatively insert an instant read thermometer horizontally into a chop; it should register about 150 degrees F for medium.   To serve: Transfer the pork chop to a warmed dinner plate and drizzle with additional glaze. Serve immediately. 
Baked Ultimate Birthday Cake,Baked,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Baked Ultimate Birthday Cake,1 (8-inch three-layer) cake 10 to 12 servings,  For the Very Vanilla Cake: 2 1/2 cups (315 g) cake flour  3/4 cup (90 g) all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 4 ounces (1 stick/115 g) unsalted butter softened plus more for the pans  1/2 cup (100 g) vegetable shortening at room temperature 1 3/4 cups (350 g) granulated sugar 2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract 1 large egg 1 cup (240 ml) ice-cold water  1/2 cup (120 ml) whole milk  1/2 cup (120 ml) well-shaken buttermilk 1 cup (190 g) rainbow sprinkles 3 large egg whites at room temperature  3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar  For the Very Vanilla Frosting: 1 1/2 cups (300 g) granulated sugar  1/3 cup (40 g) all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups (360 ml) whole milk  1/3 cup (75 ml) heavy cream 12 ounces (3 sticks/340 g) unsalted butter softened but cool cut into small pieces 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla paste 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  For Decor: 1 to 1 3/4 cups (190 to 240 g) rainbow sprinkles   ,  At first Baked was just an idea-a grand vision of thick cake slices giant cups of coffee and endless slabs of fudge-like brownies-gestating and evolving for several years in Renato's and my collective mind. It was a sweeping swirling and ambitious dream that lived inside us-alongside us. We ate a lot of cake. We drank a lot of coffee. By turns gradually and impulsively we honed the concept. First we fell in love with a neighborhood: Red Hook Brooklyn. It is the kind of neighborhood that doesn't much exist in New York City anymore. It is the kind of neighborhood that still feels special small local artistic unusual and most important neighborly. Then we fell in love with a space that needed a lot of love. Thankfully it was in the heart of Red Hook on the heart of Van Brunt Street. In the summer of 2004 we set about piecing together our physical bakery. Slowly (perhaps much too slowly) the form began to take shape. After several months of nonstop mania tears exhaustion and small triumphs we proudly birthed our baby. Baked opened to the public on January 1 2005.  We mark the occasion of our store opening aka Baked's Birthday every year. We usually do so with a lot of cake. We hope you will celebrate this happy occasion with us by making this cake. This is a very happy cake. This is the kind of birthday cake that turns gray skies blue; it is also very very tasty. Obviously our Very Vanilla Sprinkle Cake is full of vanilla. Vanilla is often the more stately less sinful sister to our beloved chocolate but it is just as powerful and enchanting in larger-than-average doses. We liberally applied vanilla to both the light white sponge cake and the smooth rich frosting. Then-because we absolutely couldn't help ourselves-we filled and covered the whole cake with a rainbow explosion of sprinkles. The visual effect is a bit ridiculous and absolutely necessary.  Baked note: If you like to decorate cakes you might want to invest in a sturdy cake turntable. While you don't absolutely need one it will certainly help to achieve smooth cakes special swirls and well…it makes adding the sprinkles to this cake a whole lot more fun.  Make the Very Vanilla Cake:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter three 8-inch (20-cm) round cake pans line the bottoms with parchment paper and butter the parchment. Dust with flour and knock out the excess flour.  Sift both flours the baking powder baking soda and salt together into a large bowl. Set aside.  In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the butter and shortening on medium speed until creamy 3 to 4 minutes. Add the sugar and vanilla and beat on medium speed until fluffy about 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl add the egg and beat until just combined.  In a small bowl whisk together the ice-cold water milk and buttermilk.  Add the flour mixture to the mixer bowl in three separate additions alternating with the water mixture beginning and ending with the flour mixture; turn the mixer to low when you add the ingredients then up to medium for a few seconds to incorporate. Scrape down the bowl then mix on low speed for a few more seconds. Remove the bowl from the standing mixer scatter the sprinkles across the top of the batter and fold them in with a rubber spatula.  In a medium bowl whisk the egg whites and cream of tartar just until soft peaks form; do not overbeat. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter with a rubber spatula.  Divide the batter among the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes rotating the pans halfway through the baking time until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack and let cool for 20 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the rack remove from the pans and let cool complete 
Perfect Pizza Dough,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/pizza/Perfect Pizza Dough,1 pound enough for 2 (12-inch) pizzas or 4 (8-inch) pizzas,   3/4 cup (2 ounces) warm water (110 degrees  to 115 degrees F) 2 3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast or 1 3/4 teaspoons instant (fresh) yeast  3 3/4 cups (16 3/4 ounces) bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 cup (8 ounces) water 3 tablespoons (1  1/2 ounces) extra virgin olive oil plus 1 tablespoon for brushing   , Pizza is a hands-down favorite anytime anywhere. And while you get good pizza when eating out truly great pizza is much easier to find at home mostly because you can top it exactly the way you want. This dough is a good starting point for your creations and can be stored in the refrigerator for 24 hours or frozen up to a month. If you like a lot of toppings roll the crust a bit thicker so it can support their weight and moisture. If you like a thin crust keep your toppings spare and packed with flavor.  Place the warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle with the yeast. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 5 minutes or until foamy. Stir to dissolve if necessary.   In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook combine the flour and salt and mix briefly to combine. Turn the mixer on low speed add the yeast mixture and mix to combine. Add the water and 3 tablespoons of olive oil and knead the dough until smooth and elastic about 5 minutes. Alternatively you can knead the dough by hand on a floured surface for about 10 minutes.   Shape the dough into a smooth ball place it on a floured surface and cover with an inverted bowl plastic wrap or a damp cloth. Let rise at room temperature for about 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in bulk.   About 30 minutes before baking the pizza place a pizza stone on the lowest rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.  When the dough is ready use a large knife or a bench scraper to divide it into 4 equal pieces. With lightly floured hands press out any bubbles that might have formed in the dough and form each piece into a small smooth ball. Place about 4 inches apart on a lightly floured surface and when your grill is preheated and ready to go roll out the dough and add toppings on the grill.

Chickpea and Artichoke Tagine,Recipe developed for Fagor by America's TEST KITCHEN,home/recipes/main-courses/vegetarian/Chickpea and Artichoke Tagine,4 to 6 servings,  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil plus extra for serving 1 onion halved and sliced thin 4 2-inch strips lemon zest 6 garlic cloves minced 1 tablespoon paprika  1/2 teaspoon ground cumin  3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3 cups vegetable broth 1 pound carrots peeled and sliced  1/2 inch thick 1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes 8 ounces (1- 3/4 cups) dried chickpeas picked over rinsed and salt-soaked 9 ounces frozen artichoke hearts thawed and patted dry  1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives halved  1/2 cup minced fresh cilantro Salt and pepper    , This Moroccan-style vegetarian stew gets complex flavor from a blend of warm spices onions garlic and lemon zest. Turning to the pressure cooker meant we could enjoy the flavor and texture of dried chickpeas rather than canned. Chopped Kalamata olives rounded out the Mediterranean profile fresh cilantro lent brightness and a drizzle of olive oil gave it the right rich finish.    Total time: About 1 hour plus bean soaking time; 25 minutes under pressure Pressure level: High Release: Quick    Build the flavor: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in pressure-cooker pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until softened about 5-minutes. Sir in lemon zest garlic paprika cumin cinnamon and cayenne and cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in broth scraping up any browned bits and smoothing out any lumps. Stir in carrots tomatoes and chickpeas.  Cook on high pressure for 25 minutes: Lock pressure-cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat. As soon as pot reaches high pressure reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 25 minutes adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure.  Quick release pressure: Remove pot from heat. Quick release pressure then carefully remove lid allowing steam to escape away from you.  Before serving: Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add artichokes and cook until golden brown 5 to 7 minutes. Remove lemon zest from stew. Stir in artichokes olives and cilantro and season with salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle individual portions with oil before serving.  Tip:  Making Chickpea Tagine in a Pressure Cooker:   Soaking chickpeas in salt water the day before cooking them ensures they cook through evenly and makes them less likely to burst open. Soaking also gives their skins a softer texture.  Before adding the soaked beans to the pot we build flavor by sauteing onion garlic a few spices and lemon zest. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the zest from the lemon in strips avoiding the bitter white pith underneath. The zest perfumes the dish and can be easily removed before serving.  Since artichokes are delicate we stir them in after cooking the chickpeas under pressure. To help bring out their flavor we brown them first. Frozen artichokes brown more easily than canned because they are less waterlogged.   Troubleshooting:  Can I substitute water or another broth for the vegetable broth?: To keep things vegetarian substitute 3 cups water for the broth and add 2 teaspoons tomato paste and 2 teaspoons soy sauce to the pot with water. If you're not a vegetarian you can substitute 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth.  Do I need to alter the recipe for a 6-quart electric pressure cooker?: Yes quick release the pressure immediately after the pressurized cooking time; do not let the cooker switch to the warm setting.  Alternate recipe:   Chickpea Tagine wtih Dried Apricots and Honey  Omit artichokes and substitute  1/2 cup pitted and halved green olives for kalamata olives. Add 1 cup dried chopped apricots and 2 tablespoons honey with olives.   
A Better Way to Turkey,ChefSteps,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/A Better Way to Turkey,1 whole cut-up turkey,  1 turkey whole fresh Black peppercorns optional for stock as needed Herbs fresh such as thyme and sage as needed 1 onion optional for stock Olive oil as needed Salt a few tbsp as needed Sugar a few tbsp as needed Butter 1 to 2 tbsp as needed   , THANKSGIVING EVE Morning:  Set sous vide tool to 150 degrees F / 66 degrees C.  Heat oven to 225 degrees F / 107 degrees C (optional for stock).  Break down turkey: 2 breasts (boneless breast with drumette) and 2 legs (thigh and drumstick together). Make stock cover and heat in oven for eight hours (or reserve in fridge and then cook overnight).  Presear breasts and legs.  Make and apply brining mixture.  Bag up breasts and legs with oil and herbs.  Begin cooking legs.  Transfer breasts to the fridge.   THANKSGIVING EVE Night (about 12 hours later): Adjust sous vide temperature to 131 degrees F / 55 degrees C.  Add breasts to the water with the legs.   THANKSGIVING DAY (Twenty minutes before the feast): Remove turkey from bags and pat dry.  Set oven to broil.  Heat pan on stove over medium-high heat.  Broil legs.  Finish breasts in the pan.  Portion plate and serve.   MAKING THE TURKEY STEP-BY-STEP:   Preheat Joule Sous Vide to 150 degrees F / 66 degrees C  Break down your bird. Make stock with the extra bits (optional but awesome): Preheat oven to 225 degrees F / 107 degrees C. Place turkey leftovers-carcass extra skin any meat bits-in a dutch oven with a lid. Slice the onion in half and add it plus peppercorns fresh herbs and any other seasonings you want. Add enough water to cover everything then put on the lid. Cook stock for about eight hours (or overnight). Strain and use in gravy freeze for later or stick in the fridge for making Black Friday turkey pho with the leftover meat.  Presear your pieces: Set up your station by arranging turkey pieces on a tray or platter next to the stove. Grab a couple of kitchen towels and place them beside the turkey. Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add a healthy amount of oil. Let the pan get really hot-hot enough that when you flick a few drops of water in there they sizzle. Grab one of the breasts and place it skin side down in the pan-lower the section closest to you first so that there is less of a chance of getting splattered with hot oil. Use a towel (or some tongs) to press down firmly on the breast so that as much skin as possible makes contact with the pan. Rotate that breast around the pan then carefully tilt the pan toward you to create a small pool of oil so you can get the skin along the sides. Sear for a minute or two then remove and follow the same process with the second breast. Repeat with each of the legs.  Combine salt and sugar; bag everything up: In a bowl combine 5 parts salt and 2 parts sugar and stir. Sprinkle all over your turkey pieces (NOTE: We use 1.5 percent of the weight of the meat in salt-sugar mixture.) If you tend to like things lightly seasoned you can reduce that to 1 percent. Place the turkey breasts some herbs (we like sage) and a little oil together in a two-gallon bag. In a second bag combine legs fresh herbs and oil. Let the breasts cool to room temperature than transfer to the fridge until it's time to cook them.   Cook legs for 12 hours: Lower bag into the water and clip to the side of your pot. Wrap pot in high-quality plastic wrap or cover with a lid to prevent evaporation.   Adjust temp to 131 degrees F / 55 degrees C and add breasts: Once legs have cooked for 12 hours set your sous vide tool to 131 degrees F / 55 degrees C. Just leave those legs in the pot they're gonna be great. Add breasts to the water with the legs. Cover the pot back up with plastic wrap or a lid.  Finish: Remember this recipe is very forgiving. Once legs have cooked you can add the breasts and continue cooking for anywhere from 8 to 14 more hours and that. turkey. is. going. to. be. epic. Turn on your oven's broil setting. Transfer the  
Faux-Stone Cake,Martha Stewart,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Faux-Stone Cake,one 9-inch layer cake,  Two 9-inch cakes  (see Mix-and-Match  Cakes page 226) Frosting (see Mix-and-Match Frostings page 237) 3 envelopes ( 3/4 ounce each) unflavored gelatin  1/2 cup cold water 1 1/2 cups sugar 7 ounces sweetened condensed milk Pinch of kosher salt 12 ounces white chocolate coarsely chopped Gel-paste food coloring in 3 shades of blue such as Wedgwood Sky Blue and Royal Blue   , The key to this high-gloss showstopper is combining different shades of white chocolate glaze: Pour it over the cake (we baked the Basic Chocolate on page 229) at the right temperature so it dries to a mirror-like finish. We chose three shades of blue here but you could use a different color combination to replicate your favorite stone  With a serrated knife trim tops of cake layers to level. Place a layer bottom-side down on a wire rack set over a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Spread  3/4 cup frosting evenly over cake layer. Place second layer bottom-side up on top. Spread a thin layer of frosting over cake to form a crumb coat. Chill in freezer until cold and firm about 2 hours.  In a small bowl sprinkle gelatin over cold water. Let stand until softened about 5 minutes. Meanwhile combine sugar condensed milk salt and  1/2 cup water in a small saucepan; bring to a gentle simmer over low heat. Remove from heat; stir in gelatin mixture until dissolved (mixture should feel smooth when rubbed between your fingers).  Place white chocolate in a medium bowl. Pour milk mixture over chocolate and let stand 5 minutes; mix with a spatula until combined. Using an immersion blender blend until mixture is smooth. Using a fine-mesh sieve strain mixture into a large measuring cup.  Divide mixture into 4 small bowls. Add gel a drop at a time to 3 bowls until desired shades are reached. Pour all 4 back into measuring cup(do not mix). Let glaze cool until it registers 95 degrees F on a candy thermometer.  Meanwhile place a wire rack on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Transfer chilled cake to rack elevating it on a smaller-size cake pan or sturdy bowl to allow glaze to drip down and cover sides neatly.  Using a back-and-forth motion pour glaze over cake. (Gently shake baking sheet and tap it on a counter if necessary to ensure that glaze covers cake.) Using a skewer or toothpick pop any air bubbles. Let glaze set at least 30 minutes before serving. To serve dip a knife in hot water wipe it dry and cut cake into wedges.  Reprinted from Martha Stewart’s Cake Perfection Copyright &#169; 2020 by Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia LP.

Succulent Matcha Cupcakes,Martha Stewart,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Succulent Matcha Cupcakes,1 dozen,  1 cup cake flour  (not self-rising) 4 teaspoons matcha powder  1/2 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 teaspoon baking soda  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 4 tablespoons unsalted  butter room temperature  3/4 cup sugar 1 large egg  room temperature  1/2 cup whole milk Swiss Meringue  Buttercream (page 237) Gel-paste food coloring  in mint green leaf green forest green dark purple  light brown and peach   ,  With a steady hand and some basic piping techniques you can produce a veritable garden of edible succulents atop these green-tea-flavored cakes. Follow the decorating tips on page 192 practice on parchment before you get started and use a flower nail (available at baking-supply stores) for best results.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners. In a medium bowl whisk together flour matcha baking powder baking soda and salt.  With an electric mixer on high speed beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy about 3 minutes scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Reduce speed to medium. Add egg and mix until just combined. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in batches alternating with milk until combined.  Divide batter evenly among prepared cups filling each about halfway. Bake rotating tin halfway through until cupcakes spring back to the touch and a cake tester comes out clean about 16 minutes. Transfer tin to a wire rack to cool 5 minutes. Turn out cupcakes onto rack and let cool completely.  Divide buttercream into 5 bowls reserving a few tablespoons of plain. Add gel-paste food coloring to bowls a drop at a time to achieve desired shades of mint green leaf green forest green dark purple and light brown. (Make more of the shade you'll want to spread on the base of your cupcakes.) Using a star tip pipe vertical mounds of varying thickness to create cactus shapes. Use a very small round tip to pipe white dots along the sides or use a very small star tip to pipe a flower on top. To make the small individual succulents pipe onto a flower nail and then transfer to the cupcake. See page 192 for decorating details. (Cupcakes are best eaten the day they are baked.)  To create the succulents shown opposite follow the steps below. Use a flower nail (we used a #7) available at baking-supply stores. Adhere a small square of parchment to the surface of the flower nail with a dab of frosting. Pipe the design then gently slide the parchment off the nail onto a baking sheet and refrigerate about 20 minutes. Use a small offset spatula to transfer the designs to the cupcakes. To make them two-toned in color paint stripes of one color of buttercream along the inside of the piping bag then fill the bag with a second color buttercream.  Using a small petal tip (such as #104) squeeze the bag gently and pull up slowly to make an acorn shape on top of the parchment. Holding the tip against the point of the acorn wide end down and the narrow end angled in toward the acorn's center pipe a wide strip as you turn the nail enrobing the top completely. Continue turning the nail making longer petals that overlap.    Using a medium petal tip (such as #125) pipe a basic petal: Hold the bag at a 45-degree angle to the surface with the tip's wide end down and the narrow end pointed away slightly to the left. Move the tip forward and back again while you pivot the narrow end to the right creating a long fan-shaped petal. Pipe additional petals overlapping each one slightly. Using the same petal technique pipe smaller petals.  Using a U-shaped petal tip (such as #80 or #81) pipe a dot about  1/2 inch in diameter to form the base. Hold the bag at a 45-degree angle against the edge of the dot with the tip's U shape facing up. Apply pressure squeezing the bag while pulling out in a quick stroke. Repeat all around the dot; form three or more petal layers over the first making petals shorter with each layer.   Using a fine leaf tip (such as #352) pipe a small mound in the center of a flower nail to form the base. Holding the tip vertically against the surface with the pointed end of the leaf tip almost touching the mound apply gentle steady pressure as you pipe a leaf-shaped petal. Then decrease pressure as you pull away. Repeat with more leaf-shaped petals aro

Everything Bagel Rolls,Ashley Cuoco,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Everything Bagel Rolls,10 servings,  Dough: 1 3/4-cups warm milk (no hotter than 120 degrees F) 1 tablespoon active dry yeast or 2 3/4 teaspoons quick-rise yeast 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 3 3/4-cups unbleached all-purpose flour plus more for sprinkling 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter melted  Filling: 3 tablespoons poppy seeds 3 tablespoons sesame seeds 3 tablespoons dried onion 3 tablespoons dried garlic 1 tablespoons course sea salt 8 oz. cream cheese at room temperature 1 bunch chives sliced thinly on bias 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest Freshly ground pepper 1 large egg yolk 1 teaspoon water 2 tablespoons unsalted butter   , To make the dough pour  3/4-cup of the warm milk in a small bowl. Add the yeast and granulated sugar and stir to dissolve. Set the bowl aside for 8 to 10 minutes until the mixture looks foamy. If the yeast isn't foamy after 15 minutes start with a new package.   Put the flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk to blend. Make a well in the center and pour the yeasted milk into the well. Then add the remaining 1 cup warm milk and melted butter. Stir together the ingredients until you get big shaggy clumps of dough that start to stick together.   Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface. You can always add more later so don't sprinkle too much. Dump the dough clumps out of the bowl onto your work surface. Dip your hands in flour and start kneading the dough. Using the heel of both hands firmly push the top of the mound away from you. Fold the far side of the dough toward you then rotate the mound of dough a quarter turn and push again. Keep kneading until you get a smooth springy dough. It usually takes 8 to 10 minutes. To know if you have kneaded enough press your hand into the dough and remove it quickly. Your handprint should bounce back and disappear quickly. If it doesn't keep kneading.   Lightly flour your hands and the surface if the dough starts sticking. It should feel tacky like tape but not sticky and gooey. A bench scraper is handy for scraping up any bits of dough stuck to the table and to help you move the dough around.   Rub the inside of a large bowl with a thin layer of vegetable oil or coat with pan spray. Shape the dough into a ball and put it in the bowl. Lightly rub or spray the top of the dough with a little oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Set the bowl aside and let the dough rise for 45 to 60 minutes until it is twice as big.   While the bread dough finishes rising make the filling. Mix poppy seeds sesame seeds onion garlic and sea salt in a medium bowl. Stir in chives orange zest and a few good cracks of pepper. Reserve half of the seasoning mixture for sprinkling on top of finished rolls. Add cream cheese to remaining half of seasoning mixture. Crack the egg into a small bowl and beat with a fork until blended.   To roll out the dough sprinkle 3 tablespoons flour on the work surface. Turn the risen dough out of the bowl onto the floured surface and shape it into a rough rectangle. Sprinkle another tablespoon of flour on top. Starting from the edge closest to you roll gently but firmly to the edge opposite you and then back again twice. Be careful not to roll the pin off the edge of the dough or the dough will stick to the surface. Turn the dough a quarter turn and roll up and back again twice. When you turn the dough it should move easily. If it doesn't gently lift the area of stuck dough loosening it with the small metal spatula and sprinkle some more flour underneath. Repeat the rolling up and back and turning of the dough until you have a 15 by 12-inch rectangle.   Brush any excess flour from the top and bottom of the dough with the large brush and clean up any extra flour from around the dough with the bench scraper. Position the rectangle so you are facing a long side. Mix the egg yolk with the water and then using a small pastry brush brush a thin coating of the egg mixture all over the top of the dough. (You won't need all of it.) Use your fingers to scrape the filling onto the dough and spread it evenly over the surface leaving a 1-inchwide border uncovered along the long side opposite you. Starting at the long side closest to you roll up the dough into a log keeping it fairly tight as you go. When you reach the opposite side roll the dough right on top of the uncovered border. Roll the log backward so the seam is on top and pinch all along the seam to seal it.   Lightly butter a 10 by 2-inch cake pan or spray with pan spray. Using a serrated knife cut th

Easy Cream Cheese Pie Dough,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/dough/Easy Cream Cheese Pie Dough,enough dough for 9 turnovers 8 dumplings or 1 (9-or 10-inch) pie shell,  1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon sugar (omit for savory pastry) Pinch of salt 1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces 1 (8-ounce) package cold cream cheese cut into 9 pieces   , A nearly foolproof alternative to flaky dough cream cheese dough can be made in the food processor in a couple of minutes. Rich cream cheese takes the place of water and helps to bring the dough together. The high proportion of fat means it's practically impossible to toughen the pastry. The dough's tangy flavor and flaky texture accent the fruit fillings in turnovers though you could also use the dough for pies either sweet or savory.  Place the flour sugar and salt in the bowl of the food processor and process for 10 seconds to blend. Add the cold butter pieces and process for 8 to 10 seconds until the mixture looks like bread crumbs. Add the cream cheese and pulse 30 times (1-second pulses) or until large shaggy clumps of dough form.  Turn the shaggy mass out onto a work surface and knead gently 2 or 3 times to create a cohesive dough. If you are making turnovers or dumplings flatten into a 7-inch square (about  3/4 inch thick) and wrap in plastic. (For a pie shape the dough into a  3/4-inch thick round.) Chill for 30 minutes.  Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. If you are making turnovers or dumplings roll into a square about  1/8 inch thick. Use a chef's knife to trim to a 15-inch square. Use the ruler to mark 5-inch increments along all sides of the dough. With the ruler as a guide cut the dough into 9 (5-inch) squares.  Storing: place rolled-out squares between sheets of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 2 days. You may also freeze them layered between sheets of parchment wrapped in plastic and sealed in a resealable plastic freezer bag or airtight container for up to 2 months.

Steamed Mussels,Le Creuset,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Steamed Mussels,2 to 4 servings,   3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 medium shallots finely chopped 3 large garlic cloves finely chopped 1 cup dry white wine 1 cup heavy cream 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoon chopped tarragon Kosher salt 2 pounds fresh mussels scrubbed and debearded   Garnish:  Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley   Serve with:  Demi Baguette   , Eating mussels spread to France from Belgium where they were cheap and abundant along the Flemish coast. Although there are all sorts of ways to flavor the cooking liquid the basic technique for preparing mussels is straightforward.  Mussels are alive when you buy them so keep them chilled and cook them as quickly as possible after purchase. Before cooking sort through the mussels and discard any that are not tightly closed or do not close when tapped against the countertop and ones with chipped or cracked shells. Quickly sort the mussels a second time as you remove them from the pot and discard any that have not opened. In short the rule for mussels is shells closed before cooking and shells open after cooking.  In a large pot over medium-high heat warm the oil. Stir in the shallots and cook until tender about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Stir in the wine cream butter tarragon and season with salt.  Add the mussels cover and cook 2 minutes. Stir the mussels cover and continue cooking until they open 4 to 6 minutes. Discard any mussels that do not open. Sprinkle with parsley and serve at once with the broth and some crusty bread.

Moroccan Lamb Chops with Green Couscous and Tahini,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/soups-stews/meat-poultry/Moroccan Lamb Chops with Green Couscous and Tahini,4 servings,  1 small bunch cilantro 1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley  1/2 small bunch mint 1 cup whole wheat couscous 1 cup frozen peas Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ground cumin  1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika 8 lamb rib chops about 1 inch thick (about 2 1/2 lbs.)  1 tablespoon grape seed oil 1 lemon zested and juiced divided  1/3 cup tahini   , Juice cilantro parsley and mint.

Cedar-Plank Salmon with Lemon-Dill Hollandaise,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Cedar-Plank Salmon with Lemon-Dill Hollandaise,4 servings,   3/4 cup dry white wine  3/4 cup white wine vinegar 1 medium shallot minced 1 teaspoon peppercorns 4 egg yolks 1- 1/2 cups melted unsalted butter 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon minced dill  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (5-ounce) salmon fillets skin-on and pin-bones removed 1 tablespoon minced tarragon 1 tablespoon olive oil   , Cedar wood imparts the salmon with a lush smoky flavor. When cooking with planks they need to be immersed in water at least an hour prior to grilling. A water-soaked plank produces maximum smoke flavor and is more resistant to charring on the grill.   To make the lemon-dill hollandaise: In a small saucepan cook white wine vinegar shallots and peppercorns until nearly dry. Cool the reduction to room temperature then strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium stainless steel bowl-you should have about a tablespoon of liquid.    In a medium saucepan simmer two inches of water. Once the hollandaise reduction has cooled whisk in the egg yolks and place bowl over the simmering water; whisk constantly until thickened and warm. To avoid overcooking the mixture be sure that the water is just barely simmering with no visible signs of surface action just steam rising.  As the egg yolks warm they increase in volume.  If they become too warm and begin to coagulate around the sides and bottom remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.  When the yolks have tripled in volume and the mixture thickly coats the back of a spoon remove the bowl from the simmering water.  Stabilize the bowl by setting on a towel or on a towel inside of another bowl.  Add the butter in a slow thin stream whisking constantly until incorporated. The sauce will thicken as more butter is added.    If the sauce does start to break try adding a small amount of water and whisking until the sauce is smooth before adding more butter.  If that doesn’t work try cooking another egg yolk over simmering water until thickened then adding the broken hollandaise gradually into the new egg yolk.  Stir in lemon juice and dill taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve sauce immediately or hold sauce at a temperature of 145-degrees for up to two hours.  To heat cedar planks: Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium. Close grill lid and preheat to 375 degrees F. Alternatively preheat an oven to 375 degrees and place a rack in the center.  Remove the soaked cedar plank from the water and place on the grill rack. Close the grill and allow the board to heat for a few minutes until it begins to smoke or crackle. If using a plank for the first time season the plank by placing it on a preheated grill for 2 minutes turning once. Lightly toasting the plank on both sides will intensify its smoky flavor and prevent warping. When the plank starts crackling it’s ready for cooking.  To cook salmon: Using tongs arrange the salmon evenly on cedar planks. Using a silicone pastry brush lightly coat the salmon with olive and sprinkle with tarragon. Cover the grill or close the oven and cook until the fish flakes about 8 minutes.  To serve: Transfer salmon to warmed dinner plates top with a teaspoon of lemon-dill hollandaise and serve immediately.    
Tuscan Kale with Pine Nuts and Golden Raisins,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Tuscan Kale with Pine Nuts and Golden Raisins,4 servings,  2 tablespoons golden raisins  3/4 cup hot water 1 1/2pounds Tuscan kale 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 3 large cloves garlic minced 2 tablespoons pine nuts toasted Kosher or sea salt   , The crinkly-leaved greens known as Tuscan kale (or lacinato kale) get a Sicilian treatment here. The pairing of pine nuts and raisins is so commonplace in Sicily that the two are sold already mixed together. You can prepare Swiss chard turnip greens broccoli rabe or spinach by the same method. If you prefer substitute dried currants or finely diced dried apricots for the golden raisins or slivered almonds for the pine nuts. Serve with roast chicken pork or sausages.  Put the raisins in a small bowl add the hot water and soften for 20 minutes. Drain.  Fill a sink with cold water. To remove the ribs from the kale leaves easily hold each leaf upside down over the sink and with a chef's knife slice downward along each side of the rib allowing the leafy greens to fall into the sink. Discard the tough ribs. Swish the greens in the water to dislodge any dirt then lift them into a sieve or colander to drain.  Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the kale and cook until tender about 5 minutes. Drain in a sieve or colander and immediately run under cold running water until cool. Drain again and squeeze to remove excess water. Chop coarsely.  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the garlic and saute  until fragrant and lightly colored about 1 minute. Add the kale pine nuts and raisins and season with salt. Cook stirring until all the ingredients are well mixed and the kale is evenly coated with oil and hot throughout. Serve immediately.

One shortcut is to cook the sausage with the beans. And if you make Counterfeit duck confit (page 179) it's already cooked and you can cut it up and use it without browning. But don't give the beans short shrift; try to track down a good variety (see Sources page 339) or scope out your local natural foods store or a well-stocked supermarket. Cassoulet lovers insist that cassoulet needs to be rechauffe or reheated the next day for the best and most authentic flavor." -Reprinted with permission from My Paris Kitchen by David Lebovitz copyright &#169; 2014.

The next day put the ham hock in a separate large pot of water bring it to a boil decrease the heat to a steady simmer and cook for about 2 hours until the meat is tender and pulls easily from the bone. Remove the ham hock from the water and set it on a plate. When cool enough to handle remove the meat from the bones shred it in large bite-size pieces and refrigerate it. Discard the liquid.   Drain the beans; put them in the pot you used to cook the ham hock and cover with cold water. Add the ham bones to the pot of beans along with the diced pork belly carrots onions garlic bay leaves and thyme. Bring the beans to a boil decrease the heat so the beans are simmering gently and cook until the beans are soft and tender about 1 hour or longer depending on the beans. As the water boils away during cooking add more water as necessary. Taste the beans toward the end of cooking add up to 1 tablespoon of salt if necessary.  While the beans are cooking scrape any excess fat from the duck confit pieces (save it for making duck fat–fried potatoes page 220) and fry them in a skillet over medium heat until they're golden brown and crisp on both sides 5 to 8 minutes per side. (If using the Counterfeit duck confit on page 179 the duck will already be browned and ready so there's no need to recook it for this step.)  Transfer the duck pieces to a plate and pour off any excess duck fat from the pan. Prick the sausages a few times with a sharp knife then fry the sausages just to brown them on the outside; they don't need to be fully cooked through. Set the sausages on the plate with the duck pieces. When cool enough to handle cut the sausages on the diagonal into 2-inch pieces. Cut each duck thigh into three pieces; cut the drumstick off and then use a knife to divide the thigh portion into two equal pieces cutting it in half by holding the knife parallel to the bone.   When the beans are done turn off the heat. Discard the bay leaves thyme and ham bone and pluck out the carrots onions and garlic cloves. Cut the carrots into cubes and mix them back into the beans along with the shredded meat from the ham hock.   Puree the onion and garlic in a blender or food processor with a bit of the bean liquid until smooth. Stir the mixture back into the bean mixture season with pepper and taste adding more salt if desired. (Some pork products are quite salty so at this point you can adjust the salt to your taste.)   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C) with an oven rack to the top third of the oven.  In a wide casserole that holds at least 8 quarts (8l) or a roasting pan assemble the cassoulet. Ladle a layer of the bean mixture and some of the liquid into the casserole. Put half of the duck pieces and half of the sausage evenly spaced over the beans. Add another layer of beans and then put the rest of the duck and sausage pieces over the beans. Top with the remaining beans and enough of the liquid so that the beans are just barely floating in th 
Grilled Five-Spice Chicken,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Grilled Five-Spice Chicken,4 servings,  1 whole chicken 31&frasl;2 to 4 pounds  Marinade: 6 cloves garlic thinly sliced 1 large shallot coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons minced lemongrass 1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon light brown sugar  3/4 cup soy sauce  3/4 cup fish sauce 1 teaspoon five-spice powder  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   , Popular at Vietnamese restaurants this dish is easy to replicate at home. You can use the same marinade on chicken parts but a whole butterflied chicken is dramatic and less trouble to maneuver on a grill. Because the marinade contains sugar the chicken skin will char easily if placed directly over the coals or gas flame so cook the bird over indirect heat the entire time. The exterior will still develop a honey brown gloss thanks to the soy sauce and five-spice powder.  To butterfly the chicken you need to remove the backbone. You can do this with poultry shears or a chef's knife. If using poultry shears turn the chicken breast side down on a cutting board and cut from the neck to the tail along both sides of the backbone to release it. If using a chef's knife turn the chicken breast side up on a cutting board. Insert the chef's knife into the body cavity and cut along both sides of the backbone to release it. With the breast side up press on the breastbone with the heel of your hand to flatten the bird. Cut off the wing tips and discard.  To make the marinade put the garlic shallot lemongrass ginger and sugar in a food processor and pulse until very finely chopped. With the motor running add the soy sauce through the feed tube and puree until the paste is as fine as possible. Transfer to a bowl and whisk in the fish sauce five-spice powder and pepper.  Place the flattened chicken in a large baking dish pour the marinade over it and turn the bird to coat on both sides. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Alternatively you can put the chicken and its marinade in a 1-gallon heavy-duty resealable food storage bag and refrigerate. Marinate for 6 to 8 hours.  Remove the chicken from the refrigerator about 1 hour before you plan to grill. Prepare a moderate charcoal fire for indirect grilling or preheat a gas grill to medium (375&deg;F) leaving one burner unlit for indirect grilling.  Remove the chicken from the marinade reserving the marinade. Brush the skin side of the chicken with some of the marinade. Place the chicken skin side down over indirect heat. Cover the grill and cook until the skin is richly browned and crisp 15 to 20 minutes. Brush the flesh side of the chicken with the remaining marinade then turn the chicken skin side up cover the grill and continue grilling over indirect heat until the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced or an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh away from the bone registers 165&deg;F about 15 minutes longer. Let rest for 10 minutes before carving into serving pieces.   
Potato Gnocchi with Peas and Pecorino,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Potato Gnocchi with Peas and Pecorino,4 servings,  2 pounds russet potatoes  1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour plus more as needed   1/2 cup cake flour plus more as needed  2 large eggs beaten 1 teaspoon fine kosher salt plus more for simmering 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 small shallot minced 1 garlic clove minced  1/2 cup mascarpone cheese 1 cup fresh peas shelled and blanched (or thawed frozen peas)  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper  1/2 cup grated pecorino cheese   , These classic Italian potato dumplings should be light and pillow-like in texture. After forming the gnocchi cook within 2 to 3 hours or freeze for up to 1 month. To freeze lay gnocchi on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the freezer. Once they're frozen gently scrape them off the sheet pan and place in an airtight container. Once frozen gnocchi can be dropped right into the boiling water to cook.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  To make the gnocchi: Pierce the potatoes all over with a fork. Place the potatoes onto a rimmed baking sheet and bake in the oven until tender about 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle.   Using a kitchen towel and paring knife carefully peel the potatoes and immediately process potatoes with a potato ricer or food mill and evenly spread out on a clean flat surface or baking sheet.   Using a fine-mesh strainer dust the potatoes evenly with flours. Drizzle egg and salt over and knead until you have smooth cohesive dough about 2 minutes. If the dough feels sticky incorporate up to  3/4 cup more cake flour. Set gnocchi aside covered with a kitchen towel to rest for 20 minutes.   Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and cut into quarters with a bench scraper. Roll each portion into a long rope about  3/4-inch in diameter. Using the bench scraper or a knife cut the rope into  3/4-inch long pieces. Set the cut gnocchi on a lightly floured baking sheet and cover with a kitchen towel as you form the rest.   Bring a large pot of water to a gentle boil and season generously with salt.   Melt butter in a large skillet set over medium heat. Add shallots and saute until softened about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant about 30 second. Whisk in mascarpone and cook until melted in. Stir in peas and cook until peas are heated through about 2 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.    To cook the gnocchi: Add gnocchi in batches to the simmering water and cook until they float to the surface 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or spider transfer cooked dumplings to the skillet with the sauce gently stirring to coat. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   To serve: Transfer dumplings to warmed shallow pasta bowls or large rimmed serving platter; garnish generously with grated pecorino and serve immediately.

Butter flour and line bottom of cake pans with parchment paper. You will need a minimum of 3 6-inch cake pans to make this recipe. If using three cake pans divide the ingredients in half and make the recipe twice.  Preparing the batter: To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment add egg whites. Beat whites until foamy. Gradually add 1 cup sugar to the whites beating until soft peaks. Scrape whites into a clean mixing bowl and set aside.  Wipe bowl clean and set on stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment add flour remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar baking powder and salt. While on medium-low speed add 8 ounces lukewarm water into dry ingredients; increase speed to medium and add in oil egg yolk and vanilla. Beat until mixture is smooth and no streaks of flour remain scrape sides of bowl with silicone spatula as needed. Fold whites into batter in 3 additions.   Divide batter evenly between six clean bowls each portion will weigh 11 ounces. Add a scant 1/4 teaspoon gel food coloring to each bowl. Adjust coloring as needed folding coloring through as to not deflate your batter. Gently pour each colored batter into a prepared cake pan.  Transfer cakes to preheated oven bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean 15 to 20 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Turn cakes out of the pans onto the racks and cool completely.  Making the Buttercream Frosting Click Here  Cutting the Cake into Layers: Set cake on cardboard cake round same circumference as cake then on turntable. First divide cake by eye into 2 layers. Alternately using a ruler and toothpicks insert toothpicks around circumference of cake. Each layer will be ¾-1 inch thick. Insert knife into side of cake and holding knife steady and level slowly rotate turntable and move knife back and forth in gently swaying motion toward center of cake. Remove top layer and set aside. Repeat as necessary. Brush any loose crumbs off layers and turntable.  Assembling Rainbow Layers (Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet): If using a syrup evenly brush or mist over cut surface of bottom cake layer. We began with red. Apply a thin layer of Buttercream Frosting on cake and spread into a uniform layer no thicker than 1/2-inch. Top with second layer of cake and repeat process with additional layers. Straighten layers as necessary until you have all six colors layered.  Crumb Coat: Apply a generous portion of frosting to top of cake. Using a long offset spatula spread frosting smoothly and evenly to sides of cake then use overhand to spread frosting around sides of the cake. Hold the spatula vertically at a 90-degree angle to turntable or plate and slowly turn the cake. Remove excess frosting from cake and fill any holes. Set crumb coat by transferring cake to refrigerator or freezer until crumb coat is firm to the touch.  Finishing the cake: Follow crumb coat instructions above but with a larger quantity of frosting. Finish can be smooth or using the back of a spoon swooshes or spikes can be designed in the frosting. A piping bag fitted with a decorative tip can be used to pipe decorations and a decorative border around the cake. 
Challah Dough,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Challah Dough,16 challah buns or 2 braided loaves,  1 cup (8 ounces) lukewarm water (about 110 degrees F)  1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) instant yeast 4 egg yolks 1/4 cup (2 ounces) vegetable oil 3 tablespoons (2 1/4 ounce) honey 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar 4 1/2 cups (1 pound 1 ounce) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons fine kosher salt   , This dough is distinctive because of its generous use of eggs which give it a beautiful golden color. This type of dough is most familiar as challah in a braided form as the table bread for the Jewish Sabbath meal. But enriched egg breads have been made by bakers of many cultures for centuries and they aren't always braided. If you like the flavor and texture of this bread feel free to use it to make any number of other baked goods from dinner rolls to sweet cinnamon buns and even yeasted coffee cake and sweet or savory swirl breads like babka or cheese rolls. You can use either an egg white or a whole egg in the egg wash. The whole egg will create a darker crust.  In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the water and yeast and stir with a whisk to dissolve. Allow the yeast to bloom about 5 to 10 minutes. The yeast should look foamy and frothy.  Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment and on low speed add the egg yolks oil honey and sugar and mix to combine. Add the flour and salt and mix on the lowest speed for 2 minutes until the dough is a shaggy mass.  Switch to the dough hook and mix on medium-low speed and mix until the dough becomes smooth shiny and tacky about 5 minutes.  Form the dough into a ball place it in a clean lightly oiled bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the dough in a warm place and allow to double in size about 2 hours. Alternatively you may refrigerate your dough overnight.

Carne Asada,Sur La Table,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Carne Asada,6 servings,  3 whole dried ancho chilies stems and seeds removed (see note) 3 whole dried guajillo chilies stems and seeds removed (see note) 2 whole chipotle peppers canned in adobo 3/4 cup fresh juice from 2 to 3 oranges preferably sour oranges 2 tablespoons fresh juice from 2 to 3 limes 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce such as Red Boat 6 medium cloves garlic 1 small bunch cilantro leaves and tender stems only divided 1 tablespoon whole cumin seed toasted and ground 1 teaspoon whole coriander seed toasted and ground tablespoons dark brown sugar Kosher salt 2 pounds skirt steak (2 to 3 whole skirt steaks) trimmed and cut with the grain into 5- to 6-inch lengths (see note)  Warm corn or flour tortillas lime wedges diced onion fresh cilantro and avocado for serving   , WATCH HOW TO MAKE THIS RECIPE HERE>>  We can all agree on a few things here: Great carne asada should taste first of the beef. It should be buttery rich and juicy with a nice charred smoky flavor from the grill or broiler. It should also be tender enough that you can eat it in a taco or burrito but substantial enough to be served as a steak and eaten with a knife and fork. Finally the marinade should have a good balance of flavors with no single ingredient overwhelming any other. This recipe produces the carne asada of my childhood dreams.  Place dried ancho and guajillo chilies on a microwave-safe plate and microwave until pliable and toasty-smelling 10 to 20 seconds. Alternatively add to a skillet set over medium heat and cook until toasted a few minutes. Transfer to the jar of a blender and add chipotle peppers orange juice lime juice olive oil soy sauce fish sauce garlic cilantro cumin seed coriander seed and brown sugar. Blend until a smooth sauce has formed about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Transfer half of the salsa to a large bowl and the other half to a sealed container. Set aside the sealed container in the refrigerator.  Add an extra 2 teaspoons of salt to the salsa in the bowl. It should taste slightly saltier than is comfortable to taste. Add 1 piece of steak to bowl and turn to coat. Transfer to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag with the top folded over to prevent excess sauce and meat juices from contaminating the seal. Repeat with remaining steak adding it all to the same bag. Pour any excess marinade over the steak. Squeeze all air out of the bag and seal. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to overnight.  When ready to cook remove the extra salsa from the fridge to allow it to warm up a little. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting cover and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.  Remove steak from marinade and wipe off excess. Place directly over the hot side of the grill. If using a as grill cover; if using a charcoal grill leave exposed. Cook turning occasionally until steak is well charred on the outside and center registers 110°F on an instant-read thermometer 5 to 10 minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly against the grain and serve immediately passing extra salsa lime wedges avocado onions cilantro and tortillas on the side. 
Farmer’s Market Carbonara,Sur La Table,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Farmer’s Market Carbonara,4 servings,  	Fettuccine pasta: 	 	1 recipe Fresh Pasta Dough rolled into semi-thin sheets (second thinnest setting on pasta roller) and passed through the cutter attachment for fettucine or hand cut into 1/4-inch wide ribbons 	 	Carbonara: 	1/4 cup heavy whipping cream 	1 1/2 cups Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese plus more for serving 	4 large eggs 	3 tablespoons coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley 	Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 	8 ounces smoked bacon sliced crosswise into 1/4-inch thick pieces 	1/2 bunch thin asparagus stemmed and cut crosswise at a 45 degree angle into 1-inch pieces 	1 cup fresh English peas 	2 large garlic cloves minced 	Fresh herbs such as basil mint or chervil to garnish  , This springtime variation of the classic dish Spaghetti Carbonara is a perfect preparation for fresh pasta because it comes together quickly. Just remember carbonara must be enjoyed as soon as it is ready in order to appreciate the full benefits of the silky sauce.  To a small bowl add cream cheese eggs and parsley whisk to combine. Season mixture generously with salt and pepper and set aside.  For the carbonara: To a large skillet set over medium heat add bacon and cook until the fat has been rendered and bacon is golden brown and crispy about 5 minutes. Add the asparagus and pan-fry until crisp-tender about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant about 1 minute.  To cook pasta: Meanwhile heat a large pot of water over high heat until boiling. Generously season water with salt. Add pasta and stir immediately to prevent it from sticking together. Cook until al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve about a cup of pasta water and drain pasta through a colander.  Add the cooked pasta to the pan and toss to coat with the bacon asparagus peas and garlic. Turn off the heat under the skillet and evenly pour the egg mixture over pasta. Working quickly use tongs to toss and evenly coat the noodles with sauce. (The residual heat from the pan will cook the eggs and working quickly will prevent the eggs from scrambling.) If the pasta looks dry add just enough of the reserved pasta water to achieve a saucy consistency and well-coated pasta. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and generously season with black pepper.  To serve: Transfer pasta to a warmed serving platter or 4 warmed pasta bowls and top with extra parmesan and herbs for garnish. Serve immediately.

Frittata with Zucchini Cherry Tomatoes and Goat Cheese,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/breakfast/egg-dishes/Frittata with Zucchini Cherry Tomatoes and Goat Cheese,2 to 3 servings,  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 zucchini about 5 ounces ends trimmed and cut into  1/3-inch-thick slices 6 large eggs beaten 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher or sea salt Freshly ground black pepper 10 cherry tomatoes halved 2 large fresh basil leaves torn into smaller pieces 1 1/2 ounces fresh goat cheese   , You can use this recipe as a template to make frittatas with whatever your local farmers provide such as cauliflower sweet peppers leeks artichokes Swiss chard or fennel. Cook the vegetable first then incorporate with the beaten eggs and seasonings. Replace the goat cheese with grated Parmigiano Reggiano or pecorino cheese if you like. Frittatas are cooked slowly not rapidly like an omelet and they taste better when they have cooled a bit. In fact any leftover frittata-cold or at room temperature-makes a delicious sandwich tucked between two slices of toast.  Preheat a broiler and position a rack 8 to 10 inches from the element.  Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 10-inch nonstick broilerproof skillet over moderately high heat. When the oil begins to ripple add the zucchini. The slices should fit in a single layer. Cook turning once until browned on both sides. Using tongs transfer the slices to paper towels to drain and cool. Discard the oil remaining in the skillet and wipe the skillet dry with a paper towel.  Return the skillet to moderately low heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Whisk the eggs with the salt and pepper in a bowl then stir in the sautŽed zucchini. Add to the hot skillet and use a heatproof rubber spatula or fork to separate the zucchini slices so that they are evenly spaced. Cook slowly until the frittata is mostly set but still a little runny on top 8 to 10 minutes. Scatter the cherry tomatoes and basil over the surface poking them down into the moist egg. Dot with pinches of the goat cheese.  Put the skillet under the broiler element until the top is puffed firm to the touch and golden brown 2 to 3 minutes. Slide the frittata out onto a cutting board or serving platter. Let rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting into wedges. The frittata is best when warm not hot.

This method uses a biscuit cutter-more appropriate for high society.   Preheat oven to 500 degrees F and position rack in the upper portion of the oven. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with silpats or parchment paper.  In your food processor combine the flour sugar baking powder and salt and pulse to combine. Add butter and pulse until butter is incorporated and the mixture resembles sand. Transfer the flour and butter mixture to a mixing bowl.  In small bowl whisk milk and eggs. Set aside 2 tablespoons and add the remaining milk and egg mixture to the flour mixture stirring with a rubber spatula until just incorporated. The dough will be wet and sticky.   Heavily flour your work surface and your hands. Turn the dough out onto the floured surface and knead just until the dough is no longer sticky. Dust with flour and roll the dough into a 1-inch thick circle. Use a floured 2 1/2-inch round cutter to cut out scones.  Gather dough scraps and press together continue to cut out scones until all the dough is used.  (If you are making scones ahead simply chill them on the baking sheet until ready to bake.) Once scones are arranged on baking sheets brush with the reserved milk and egg mixture. Sprinkle with coarse sugar.  Place the scones in the preheated oven reduce the oven temperature to 425 degrees F and bake for 10 minutes until scones are golden brown. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.

Triple Coconut Cream Pie,Tom Douglas,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Triple Coconut Cream Pie,1 (9-inch) pie 6 to 8 Servings,  Coconut Pie Shell: 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut 8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces 2 teaspoons sugar  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  1/3 cup ice water more or less as needed  Coconut Pastry Cream: 2 cups whole milk 2 cups sweetened shredded coconut 1 vanilla bean split lengthwise 2 large eggs  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar divided 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  3/4 cup unsalted butter softened  Topping: 2 1/2 cups heavy cream chilled  1/3 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  Garnish: 1-  1/2 cups (2 ounces) unsweetened coconut "chips " (large-shred coconut) or sweetened shredded coconut 1 (4- to 6-ounce) bar white chocolate shaved   , Winner of the James Beard Award as Best Northwest Chef in 1994 Tom Douglas is a well-established icon of the Seattle culinary scene. His first restaurant Dahlia Lounge opened in 1989 and build a solid reputation as a bastion of Northwest sustainable cuisine. This amazing dessert is a long-standing fixture on the Dahlia Lounge menu.  For the Coconut Pie Shell: In a food processor combine the flour coconut butter sugar and salt. Pulse until mixture is crumbly. Add water 1 tablespoon at a time pulsing once after each addition until dough holds together when pressed between fingers. (Dough will not form a ball or even clump together in processor—it will be loose.) Turn dough out onto a large sheet of plastic wrap; press into a disc. Cover with plastic wrap and chill 30 to 60 minutes.  On a lightly floured work surface roll the dough to a 12 to 13 inch circle. Fit into a 9-inch pie plate (don't stretch the dough) trimming excess to a 1- to 1-1/2-inch overhang. Turn dough under along rim of pie pan and flute edges. Chill at least 1 hour before baking.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees  . Place a sheet of aluminum foil or parchment paper the pie shell extending over edges and fill with dried beans rice or pie weights. Bake at 400 degrees   for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven; remove the foil and beans and return pie crust to oven. Bake for 10 to 12 more minutes or until the bottom of the crust has golden brown patches. Remove from oven and cool completely before filling.  For the Coconut Pastry Cream:  Combine milk and coconut in a medium saucepan. Split vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape seeds into milk mixture. Add pod. Cook over medium-high heat stirring occasionally until mixture almost comes to a boil. Remove from heat.  In another bowl whisk together eggs sugar and flour in a medium bowl until well blended. Temper the eggs by whisking about  1/3cup of the milk mixture into egg mixture. Add the warmed egg mixture to the saucepan with the milk mixture. Cook over medium heat whisking constantly 5 minutes or until mixture thickens and begins to bubble. Whisk about 4 to 5 more minutes or until very thick. Remove from heat; add butter and whisk until melted. Discard vanilla pod.   Transfer mixture to a medium bowl and place entire bowl in a larger bowl of ice water. Stir occasionally until mixture cools. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on surface of mixture and refrigerate until completely cold about 4 hours. The mixture will thicken as it cools.  Fill baked pie shell with the pastry cream smoothing surface. Beat whipping cream sugar and vanilla extract at medium speed with an electric mixer until foamy. Gradually increase speed to high and beat until soft peaks form. Pipe or spoon whipped cream over pie.  To garnish and serve:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees . Spread coconut chips on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees  for 7 to 8 minutes or until lightly brown stirring twice. Cool coconut chips before decorating the top of the pie. Using a vegetable peeler scrape white chocolate into curls on top of the pie. 
Sour Cherry Linzer Tart,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Sour Cherry Linzer Tart,1 (9-inch) tart,  Tart Crust: 1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter softened (65 degrees  to 68 degrees F)  3/4 cup (5 3/4 ounces) sugar 1 large egg 1 large egg yolk  3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Finely grated zest of 1 large orange Finely grated zest of 1 large lemon 1&#185;&#8260;&#179; cups (6 1/2 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour &#185;&#8260;&#179; cup (1 1/2 ounces) whole natural almonds  3/4 cup (1 ounce) whole hazelnuts 1 3/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon ground cloves  1/2 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 teaspoon salt  Filling: 2 cups (16 ounces) cherry or berry juice  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar 2 (3-inch) cinnamon sticks  1/2 vanilla bean 1 cup (8 ounces) firmly packed dried sour cherries 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon water Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for serving   , A linzer tart is a lattice-topped Austrian specialty featuring a crust rich with butter spices and ground nuts enveloping a filling of raspberry jam. While a good-quality seedless raspberry jam would be delicious as the filling you'll love the way dried sour cherries add their bright tart flavor to this modern take on the classic favorite. Feel free to substitute 1 3/4 cups raspberry jam for the filling if you'd like to make the traditional tart. Good any time of year this dessert is especially welcome during the holidays when the fragrance of cinnamon and cloves fills the house with the irresistible scent of winter baking.  Tart Crust: Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer and beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy looking 2 to 3 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl though you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape down the bowl with a spatula. Add the egg and egg yolk and blend well. Scrape down the bowl again. Add the vanilla orange zest and lemon zest and blend well; scrape down the bowl once more.  Place the flour almonds hazelnuts cinnamon cloves baking powder and salt in the bowl of the food processor and process until the nuts are finely ground about 45 seconds. Add to the butter mixture and blend on low just until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed.  Divide the dough: Split the dough into two portions one slightly larger than the other. (The larger piece will line the tart pan while the smaller portion will be piped in a lattice pattern over the top of the tart.) Wrap the larger portion in plastic and refrigerate for 30 to 45 minutes until firm enough to press into the tart pan without it sticking to your hands. Spoon the smaller portion of dough into the pastry bag fitted with the &#179;&#8260;8-inch plain round tip and set aside at room temperature.  Filling: Combine the juice sugar and cinnamon sticks in the small saucepan. Split the vanilla bean and scrape the seeds into the pan adding the pod as well. Add the dried cherries. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the cherries are plump and soft 15 to 20 minutes. Pour the mixture through the fine-mesh strainer into the medium bowl. Return the juices to the saucepan and place the cherries in the medium bowl. Discard the cinnamon stick and vanilla bean pod. Bring the juices to a simmer. In the small bowl whisk together the cornstarch and water until smooth. Pour the cornstarch mixture into the simmering juice whisking constantly. Cook until the liquid thickens 30 to 60 seconds then immediately pour over the cherries and stir to blend. Cool completely (to speed cooling place the bowl of cherries in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and stir occasionally).  Press the larger portion of chilled dough evenly across the bottom and up the sides of the tart pan. Chill in the refrigerator or freezer for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the lower third.  Spread the cherry filling evenly in the chilled shell. Using the dough in the pastry bag create an angled lattice: Pipe straight lines of dough about 1 inch apart across the surface of the filling. Then pipe slanted lines of dough over the straight lines crossing them at an angle to create a diamond pattern. (Note: You won't need all the dough in the bag-you can roll and cut the leftover dough into shapes with a cookie cutter and make linzer cookies.).  Bake the tart for 40 to 45 minutes until the filling is bubbling and the dough is nicely browned. Transfer to a cooling rack making sure you hold the pan by the sides and not the bottom (remember it's a two-piece pan and can come apart!).  Place the tart pan on top of a large can from your pantry (the 28-ounce tomato cans are good) so that the bottom balan 
Traditional Potato Gnocchi with Brown Butter and Sage,No Author,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Traditional Potato Gnocchi with Brown Butter and Sage,4 servings,  Brown butter sauce:  1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 2 tablespoons thinly sliced sage leaves Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for serving  Potato gnocchi: 2 pounds russet potatoes  1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour plus more as needed  1/2 cup cake flour plus more as needed 2 large eggs beaten 1 teaspoon sea salt plus more for simmering   , These classic Italian potato dumplings should be light and pillow-like in texture. After forming the gnocchi cook within 2 to 3 hours or freeze for up to 1 month. To freeze lay gnocchi on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the freezer. Once they’re frozen gently scrape them off the sheet pan and place in an airtight container. Once frozen gnocchi can be dropped right into the boiling water to cook.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. To make the gnocchi: Pierce the potatoes all over with a fork. Place the potatoes onto a rimmed baking sheet and bake in the oven until tender about 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle.  Using a kitchen towel and paring knife carefully peel the potatoes and immediately process potatoes with a potato ricer or food mill and evenly spread out on a clean flat surface or baking sheet.  Using a fine-mesh strainer dust the potatoes evenly with flours. Drizzle egg and salt over and knead until you have smooth cohesive dough about 2 minutes. If the dough feels sticky incorporate up to  3/4-cup more cake flour. Set gnocchi aside covered with a kitchen towel to rest for twenty minutes.  Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and cut into quarters with a bench scraper. Roll each portion into a long rope about  3/4-inch in diameter. Using the bench scraper or a knife cut the rope into  3/4-inch long pieces. Set the cut gnocchi on a lightly floured baking sheet and cover with a kitchen towel as you form the rest.  Bring a large pot of water to a gentle boil and season generously with salt. To prepare brown butter sauce: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat stirring occasionally until the milk solids turn golden brown and the butter takes on a nutty aroma. Stir in sherry vinegar and sage. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low.  Meanwhile add gnocchi in batches to the simmering water and cook until they float to the surface 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon transfer cooked dumplings to the skillet with the sauce gently stirring to coat with the butter and sage. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. Transfer to warmed shallow pasta bowls or large rimmed serving platter; garnish generously with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and serve immediately.  Steps to Perfect Gnocchi: 1- We recommend russet potatoes for gnocchi; they are drier and fluffier than other potatoes. While Yukon Gold potatoes are also a common favorite because of their buttery flavor they are easily over worked resulting in a gummy consistency. 2- Always bake the potatoes instead of boiling them this prevents the potatoes from becoming too wet (requiring more flour in the dough). You’ll also get more flavorful results as some of the potato flavor is lost during boiling. 3- When the potatoes are cool enough to handle pass the potatoes through a potato ricer or food mill. This tool will produce a fluffier result and lighter gnocchi. Mashing will produce a thicker potato product resulting in heavier dough. 4- Be careful not to overmix the dough as it will make the gnocchi tough. Spread the riced potato evenly on a flat surface or baking sheet. Use a fine-mesh strainer to dust the flour over the potato before gently kneading into smooth dough. 5- Unbleached all-purpose flour will work just fine for making gnocchi. However we have found that the addition of cake flour makes for an even lighter dumpling because of its lower protein content and finer texture. 6- Like any dough gnocchi dough likes a rest. Time your gnocchi production to allow for a 20 minute rest before rolling out gnocchi. 7- Often you’ll see Italian gnocchi made by pressing the finished dough over a floured fork or ridged wooden gnocchi paddle which imparts grooves that help to trap the sauce on the gnocchi.

Blueberry Nectarine Crisp,Amanda Haas,home/recipes/desserts/crisps-crumbles/Blueberry Nectarine Crisp,1 serving,  2 cups rolled oats 1 cup flour 1/2 cup almond flour 3/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar Zest and juice of 1 lemon 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt plus more if needed 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter cut into 12 pieces 6 cups fresh blueberries 2 tablespoons cane sugar or more to taste 2 tablespoons cornstarch or instant tapioca 6 nectarines sliced into wedges (should yield 4-6 cups sliced)  Whipped cream or vanilla bean ice cream optional    , This simple berry crisp from our chef partner Amanda Haas is one of the most versatile and delicious desserts for entertaining. Amanda notes that once the crisp topping is mastered the fruits for the filling can be varied according to the season. In late summer when stone fruits are still plentiful and berries are available the combination of nectarines and blueberries is hard to beat. As fall arrives summer stone fruits can be swapped for combinations of apples pears and even persimmons. The topping also freezes very well making it easy to use any time you have beautiful ripe fruit and feel like baking a delicious dessert.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.   To make the crisp topping combine the oats flour almond flour brown sugar lemon zest and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and working quickly use your fingertips or a pastry blender to cut the butter into small pieces until a crumbly mixture is formed.  There should be no pieces of butter larger than a penny. Refrigerate the topping until ready to use.  Place the blueberries directly in the Sauteuse.  Pour the lemon juice over the berries then sprinkle with sugar and cornstarch. Toss the berries to coat them evenly with the sugar mixture.  Add the nectarines and stir gently to combine with the berries. Distribute the crisp topping evenly over the fruit.  Place the Sauteuse on a sheet pan to catch any drips if the fruit bubbles over then place in the preheated oven without the lid.  Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the top is evenly browned and the fruit is warm and bubbling. If the topping begins to darken before the fruit is ready place the lid over the top of the crisp.     Allow the crisp to cool for 20 minutes then serve with whipped cream or ice cream if desired.   Photography by Andee McKenzie

Classic Chicken and Chorizo Paella,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Classic Chicken and Chorizo Paella, to 8 servings,  Sofrito: 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup finely diced yellow onion   1/2 cup finely diced red bell pepper 1 tablespoon minced garlic  1 cup crushed tomatoes or fresh tomato grated on a box grater     1/2 teaspoon piment&#243;n   1/2 teaspoon sea salt  1 bay leaf  Paella: 3  1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  2 tablespoons olive oil  10 ounces boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 2) cut into 1-inch pieces  1 generous pinch saffron   2 teaspoons piment&#243;n  1 teaspoon turmeric 4 ounces Spanish-style chorizo diced into  3/4-inch pieces    1  1/2 cups Spanish paella rice  2 teaspoons sea salt   1/3-cup fresh shelled or frozen peas thawed  2 lemons cut into wedges   , Cooking paella is a fun and interactive experience. You can always modify the ingredients to make your paella more seasonal and since it is cooked entirely in one vessel paella is the original one pot meal!  To prepare the sofrito: Heat the oil in a paella pan or medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions stirring frequently until tender and lightly caramelized 5 to 8 minutes. Add red pepper and garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes piment&#243;n salt and bay. Reduce heat to medium and stir frequently until the sauce is thick and turns a deep brick red color about 10 minutes.   Bring chicken broth to a simmer in a large saucepan; reduce heat to low and cover to keep broth hot.   To prepare the paella: Push the sofrito to the side of the pan and add oil. When oil is shimmering add chicken to the pan and sauté until browned about 5 minutes. Make another space in the center of the paella pan; add the spices and toast for 30 seconds. Add the chorizo and stir to combine with sofrito chicken and spices. Ladle 3 cups hot broth into the pan and stir in rice and salt shaking the pan to evenly distribute the rice grains. Increase the heat to medium-high and boil for 5 to 7 minutes or until the rice just starts to break the surface of the broth. Reduce heat to medium-low cover and simmer gently undisturbed for 10 minutes. During the process if the rice looks dry and undercooked drizzle in additional chicken broth.   Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high; cook for about 2 minutes until the bottom layer of rice starts to crackle and caramelize creating the socarrat. At this point you will need to closely monitor the paella and frequently move your pan around on the burner to evenly distribute the heat.  With a spoon gently scrape a small portion of rice from the bottom peeking to make sure the rice is sticking and caramelizing but not burning (the rice should smell toasty not burnt). If the rice is browned and caramelized on the bottom of the pan and the rice grains are al dente (chewy but slightly resistant texture) remove from heat; sprinkle peas over the rice and cover letting the paella rest for 10 minutes. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve family-style straight from the pan.

Smoked Maple Manhattan with Garbage Can Bitters,Recipe courtesy of Scraps,home/recipes/beverages/alcoholic-beverages/Smoked Maple Manhattan with Garbage Can Bitters,tail and about 2 pints bitters  Learn more about Scraps ,  Garbage Can Bitters:  3/4 cup whole coffee beans (or spent dried coffee grounds or spent dried tea leaves) Handful whole spices (allspice cloves star anise fennel etc.) Handful of citrus peels 2 tablespoons maple syrup 2 cups 101-proof bourbon  For each cocktail: Spoonful of Garbage Can Bitters Spoonful of maple syrup 2 parts bourbon 1 part sweet vermouth 2 dashes store-bought gravy enhancer or leftover Thanksgiving turkey pan scrapings (optional)   , Make bitters: Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil remove from heat and keep warm.  Toast spices: In a medium cast iron skillet over medium heat add coffee (or tea) spices and citrus peels. Toast tossing frequently until fragrant. Carefully light ingredients with a blow torch or a match until just smoking (do not stir). When smoke dies down put ingredients in a large glass jar. Add maple syrup and liquor.   Put jar in saucepan of warm water (don't close the jar). Allow to steep until water bath is cool (a few hours). Strain before using.  Make the cocktail: In a mixing glass with ice stir the bitters maple syrup bourbon vermouth and gravy enhancer (if using). Strain over a glass with ice.  Notes from mixologist/mad scientist Aaron Wisniewski of Alice & the Magician: Get creative with what you have in your pantry for these "garbage can" bitters. Nuts (even burned ones!) herb stems old citrus peels expired spices fresh ginger cranberries rhubarb lavender dandelion root and burnt wood/firewood all add their own special flavor to your concoction.  This accelerated-infusion method of making bitters will be ready to use after a couple hours of steeping. Once covered they last for about 1 year if stored in a cool dark place. The flavors will intensify with time.  The gravy enhancer (or your own pan scrapings from Thanksgiving dinner!) add a unique umami note to the cocktail.

Soft and Sweet Cinnamon Rolls,Simple Comforts: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/Soft and Sweet Cinnamon Rolls,10 rolls,  Dough: 1 3/4 cups warm milk (no hotter than 120&deg;F) 1 tablespoon active dry yeast or 2 3/4 teaspoons quick-rise yeast 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 3 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour plus more for sprinkling 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter melted  Egg wash: 1 large egg yolk 1 teaspoon water  Filling: 1 1/2 cups lightly packed light brown sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 1 large egg  Icing: 1 cup powdered sugar or a little more if needed 1 1/2 tablespoons water   , To make dough pour  3/4 cup warm milk in a small bowl. Add yeast and granulated sugar and stir to dissolve. Set bowl aside for 8 to 10 minutes until the mixture looks foamy. If the yeast isn't foamy after 15 minutes start with a new package. Put flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk to blend. Make well in center and pour yeasted milk into well. Then add remaining 1 cup warm milk and melted butter. Stir together until you get big shaggy clumps of dough that start to stick together. Sprinkle a little flour on work surface. Dump dough clumps out of bowl onto work surface. Dip hands in flour and start kneading. Keep kneading until you get a smooth springy dough. It usually takes 8 to 10 minutes. To know if you have kneaded enough press your hand into the dough and remove it quickly. Your handprint should bounce back and disappear quickly.  Rub inside of large bowl with thin layer of vegetable oil or coat with pan spray. Shape dough into a ball and put it in the bowl. Lightly rub or spray the top of dough with a little oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Set the bowl aside and let the dough rise for 45 to 60 minutes until it is twice as big. While bread dough finishes rising make the filling. Put brown sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl and whisk until well blended. Crack egg into a small bowl and beat with fork until blended. To roll out dough sprinkle 3 tablespoons flour on work surface. Turn the risen dough out onto the floured surface and shape into a rough rectangle. Sprinkle another tablespoon of flour on top. Starting from edge closest to you roll gently but firmly to edge opposite you and then back again twice. Turn dough a quarter turn and roll up and back again twice. Repeat until you have a 15 by 12-inch rectangle. Brush any excess flour from dough with large brush. Position rectangle so you are facing long side. Mix egg yolk with water and then using a small pastry brush brush a thin coating of the egg mixture all over the top of the dough.  Use your fingers to scrape filling onto dough and spread it evenly over surface leaving a 1-inch border uncovered along the long side opposite you. Starting at long side closest to you roll up dough into a log. When you reach opposite side roll dough on top of uncovered border. Roll log backward so seam is on top and pinch along seam to seal it. Lightly butter 10 by 2-inch cake pan or spray with pan spray. Using a serrated knife cut log crosswise into 10 rolls each about 1 1/2 inches wide. Arrange rolls in prepared cake pan evenly.  Cover pan with plastic wrap and set in a warm place. Let rolls rise for about 1 hour or until they are nearly twice as big and almost fill the pan. After rolls have risen for about 30 minutes position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees  F.  Bake rolls for 30 to 35 minutes until they are golden and the sugar is bubbling around the edges. Using oven mitts transfer pan to a cooling rack. Let cool for 10 to 15 minutes.  To make icing put 1 cup powdered sugar in a small bowl. Add water and whisk until completely smooth. Drizzle the icing over cinnamon rolls and eat while warm. 
Sauteed Haricots Verts and Shallots,Jacques Pepin,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Sauteed Haricots Verts and Shallots,4 servings,  1 pound haricots verts or very small string beans tips removed 1 tablespoon unsalted butter  1 tablespoon peanut oil 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots   3/4 teaspoon salt  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   ,  This harmonious combination of green beans shallots and butter is a winner. Try to get authentic haricots verts thin very young green beans - available in specialty food stores or at farmers' markets - or choose the smallest firmest regular string beans you can find.

Add the beans and cook covered over high heat for 7 to 8 minutes until they are tender but still firm to the bite. Drain the beans and spread them on a large platter to cool.  At serving time heat the butter and oil in a large skillet. When they are hot add the shallots and saute for about 10 seconds. Add the beans salt and pepper and saute for about 2 minutes until the beans are heated through. Serve.

Classic Lemon Bars,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Classic Lemon Bars,36 (1 1/2-inch) squares,  1 recipe Vanilla Shortcrust Dough prepared through Step 2 4 large eggs 2 cups (14 ounces) granulated sugar 5 tablespoons (1 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour  2/3 cup (5 2/3 ounces) strained freshly squeezed lemon juice Confectioners' sugar for dusting (optional)  Vanilla Shortcrust Dough: Click for recipe »   , Eyes light up at the sight of these tart and refreshing favorites. A soft puckery lemon filling atop a vanilla-scented shortcrust is just the ticket after a rich winter meal and it is also a refreshing treat on a hot summer day. Okay okay it's great anytime. Surprisingly easy to make these bars deliver a lot of satisfaction for the amount of elbow grease invested. Of course lemon is the classic but you could substitute lime juice as well. Or for a more exotic version try an equal amount of passion fruit juice instead of the lemon juice.  Line the pan with foil across the bottom and up all four sides then lightly coat with melted butter oil or high-heat canola-oil spray. With the spatula scrape the dough into the prepared pan and press it into an even layer across the bottom of the pan. Chill for 30 minutes.  Bake the chilled crust for 35 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees F until golden brown. Transfer to a rack and allow to cool for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300&deg;F.  Whisk the eggs and granulated sugar together in the medium bowl. Whisk in the flour until there are no lumps. Whisk in the lemon juice. Pour the filling over the crust. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until the filling is set and does not jiggle when you tap the side of the pan. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. When cool refrigerate for 1 hour.  To serve grasp the foil and lift the cookies out of the pan. Set them on a cutting surface. Gently peel back the foil using the tip of a thin knife or small spatula to help separate the bars from the foil if necessary. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares and transfer to a serving plate or storage container. Just before serving use a fine-mesh strainer to dust confectioners' sugar over the tops. (Wait until the last minute to do this or the confectioners' sugar will soak into the filling and look blotchy.)  Storing: The bars keep well at room temperature for 1 day. For longer storage keep them airtight in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The bars cannot be frozen however because the crust becomes soggy when defrosted.

Crystal Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow),Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Crystal Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow),30 dumplings,  For the filling: 1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp roughly chopped  3/4 cup minced bamboo shoots 1 tablespoon minced green onion 1 tablespoon minced cilantro leaves 1 teaspoon peeled and grated fresh ginger root 2 tablespoons minced pork fat or minced fatty bacon 1 tablespoon soy sauce 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine or dry sherry 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 teaspoons sesame oil 4 teaspoons tapioca starch or corn starch  1/8 teaspoon white pepper  For the dough: 1 3/4 cup wheat starch  3/4 cup tapioca starch  3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 cup boiling water 2 teaspoons vegetable oil Cabbage leaves for lining steamers   ,  Plump and juicy with chunks of shrimp barely visible through translucent dough har gow are one of the most widely recognized dim sum classics. The wheat starch skin that encases the filling is cut with tapioca to give it elasticity. A metal tortilla press is excellent for pressing out dough balls to the desired shape and thickness for the dumpling. Line the press with wax paper to prevent sticking.  To make filling: In a medium bowl stir to combine the shrimp bamboo shoots green onions cilantro ginger and pork. In a small bowl combine the soy sauce wine sugar salt sesame oil tapioca starch and white pepper and stir thoroughly. Pour the soy mixture over the shrimp mixture and mix well with a silicone spatula. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator while you prepare the dough.  To make dough: In a medium bowl add the wheat starch tapioca starch and salt and stir well with a wooden spoon to combine. Add the boiling water and canola oil and stir until well combined. Transfer the dough while it is still hot onto a clean surface dusted with wheat starch. Knead until smooth adding a little more wheat starch if necessary. The dough should be soft but not sticky. Transfer warm dough to a gallon size plastic zip lock bag to prevent the dough from drying out.  To form dumplings: Fill a small bowl with water for sealing edges. Lightly dust a clean work surface with wheat starch. Cut the dough into 4 sections and roll each section into an 8-inch long rope using the palms of your hands. Cut each rope into 8 pieces and roll into balls. Place any dough you’re not working with in the plastic bag. Using a small rolling pin or tortilla press flatten each ball into a circle about 3-inch diameter and about a  1/8-inch thick. Make sure to keep the finished rounds of dough stacked up inside the plastic bag so that they don't dry out before you can fill them. Take one disc out of the bag and make 7 pleats on one half of the disc. The disc should now be shaped like a bowl. Fill the bowl with a heaping teaspoon of the filling. Moisten the un-pleated side of the wrapper with a bit of water and press the edges of the dumpling together to seal. Repeat with remaining rounds.  To cook dumplings: Pour water into a wok or large pot to a depth of 3 inches and heat over medium-high heat to a strong simmer. Stack bamboo steamers in the wok or place a steamer insert into the pot. Steamer should not touch the surface of the water. Line the steamer with cabbage leaves or oiled sheets of parchment paper. Arrange dumplings in steamers at least  1/2 inch apart. Cover steamer and steam dumplings until filling is cooked through and wrappers are translucent about 6 to 8 minutes.  To serve: Arrange the dumplings onto warmed plates or platters and serve immediately with soy dipping sauce.

Baked Mac and Cheese Recipe,Quin Liburd @butterbeready,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Baked Mac and Cheese Recipe, 6 servings,  8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese block-style 8 ounces smoked gouda cheese block-style 8 ounces pepper jack cheese block-style 1 8-ounce block Velveeta cheese (original flavor) cubed 1 pound dried elbow macaroni pasta 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/4 cup all purpose flour (or gluten-free flour if needed)  2 cups whole milk (or milk of choice)  2 cups half-and-half 1 teaspoon kosher salt plus more to taste 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ground mustard 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon (a pinch) cayenne pepper- optional   , Preheat the oven to 375 degrees  F. Generously grease/butter a 9x13-inch baking dish (or something comparable: use whatever oven-safe vessel you have). Then set the dish aside. Prep the cheeses: Use a food processor or handheld boxed grater to shred the cheddar cheese smoked gouda cheese and the pepper jack cheese. Place the shredded cheeses into a large bowl and place the cubed cheese into another bowl. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once the water is boiling add in the elbow macaroni. Cook the pasta just until al dente (cooked but firm)- this should take no more than 5-6 minutes!  Do not over cook the pasta as it will continue cooking while baking in the oven. Then drain the pasta in a large colander- do not shut off the heat. Rinse the pasta under cool water to stop the cooking process and leave the pasta in the colander set aside. Return the empty large pot to the stove. Add the butter into the same pot over medium heat. Once the butter melts completely and begins to sizzle add in the flour. Use a wooden spoon/utensil to stir the flour into the butter until it dissolves. Allow the mixture to cook stirring until the mixture turns a light golden color- about 2-3 minutes to cook off the flour. Slowly whisk in the milk and half-and-half and bring this mixture to a nice simmer while continuing to whisk. Make sure there are no lumps at all. Simmer for about 5 minutes and then remove from heat. Stir in the seasonings: salt pepper ground mustard garlic powder onion powder smoked paprika nutmeg and cayenne (if using). Followed by three-quarters of the shredded cheese (leave about 1/4 cup of each cheese for sprinkling on top). Use a rubber spatula to fold everything into the sauce until it thickens and everything is fully incorporated. Add the cooked macaroni into the cheese sauce and toss together to combine make sure all of the macaroni is well coated. Carefully empty the mixture into your prepared baking dish. Nestle the cubed pieces of velveeta cheese into the macaroni all over. Then sprinkle the reserved bit of shredded cheeses that you have directly on top of the dish. Then place the baking dish on top of a large baking sheet (just in case anything bubbles over). Bake the mac and cheese uncovered for 35 minutes or until the top of the dish is golden brown crispy and bubbly throughout. Afterwards I like to reset the oven to the broiler setting to get a deeper slightly blistered browning on top- this takes just about 1 minute! Serve immediately and enjoy!

She has closed the restaurant sadly but fortunately she has not lost her omelet technique. Her secret is whisking the eggs furiously until they produce a frothy foam a step that yields an especially light result.  Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet over moderately low heat. Add the leeks season with salt and pepper and stir to coat with the butter. Cover and cook stirring occasionally until the leeks are tender but not meltingly soft about 10 minutes.  In a small bowl mash the goat cheese with the chervil until blended.  Crack the eggs into a bowl and add the chives parsley and water. Beat vigorously with a whisk until the eggs are light and very foamy.  Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat. When the butter begins to sizzle and foam add the eggs and spread them in an even layer with a heatproof rubber spatula. Let the eggs set for a few seconds then use the spatula to push the firmer cooked egg at the edges toward the center of the skillet so that the uncooked portion flows onto the bare pan bottom. With the spatula gently pat the eggs into an even layer.  When the eggs have almost completely set but are still a little moist on the surface dollop the goat cheese on one-half. Spoon the leeks over the goat cheese. Fold the other half of the omelet over the filling and slide the omelet onto a warm plate. Top with a little parsley and serve immediately.

Pulse to combine. Add the eggs and squid ink and process for 30 to 60 seconds or until the mixture comes together into a ball. When the pasta dough is thoroughly mixed turn it out on a lightly floured work surface. Knead dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky adding small amounts of flour as needed; 2 to 3 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest for at least 20 minutes or up to an hour at room temperature.  To roll dough: Secure a pasta machine to the edge of a long countertop. Using a bench scraper cut the dough into three pieces. Keep extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with one piece. With a rolling pin roll the piece of dough into a rough rectangle so that it will fit inside the widest setting of the pasta machine. Roll the dough through the machine catching it with one hand as you roll with the other. Take the dough and trifold it like a letter. Turn the dough so one open end faces the machine and roll it through on the widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting.   Continue rolling the pasta through the machine without folding adjusting the rollers to a smaller setting each time until the desired thickness is reached. If the pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.  Cut sheets to desired shapes and sizes toss with semolina flour and set aside covered with a clean kitchen towel. The pasta can be cooked immediately or covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use.   To cook pasta: Heat a large pot of water over high heat until boiling. Generously season water with salt. Add pasta and stir immediately to prevent the strands from sticking together. Boil until al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve about a cup of pasta water and drain pasta through a colander. Toss hot pasta with your sauce of choice using reserved pasta water to thin the mixture and coat the pasta as needed. Garnish as desired and serve immediately.

Cherry Limeade Quick Pops,Zoku,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Cherry Limeade Quick Pops,6 pops,  1 cup (8 fl oz) all natural limeade 6 ounces (a heaping cup) fresh or frozen pitted sweet dark cherries Zest of a fresh lime   , In a blender combine limeade cherries and lime zest; puree until smooth.  Insert the sticks into the Zoku Quick Pop Maker and pour the cherry-limeade base to the fill line of each cavity. Let freeze completely then remove the pops with the Super Tool. Repeat with remaining pops. If you're going for the striped look layer the cherry-limeade base with plain limeade-just be sure to allow each layer to freeze before adding the next layer. Please note that layering flavors will require a longer freezing time for each batch of Quick Pops. Please note that the mixture will be thicker when frozen cherries are used. If you find your mixture to be too thick simply thin it down with a little more limeade. The color of your Cherry Limeade Quick Pops will vary depending on the variety of cherries you use.  Tip: We recommend tasting the base before filling the Zoku Quick Pop Maker. If your cherries are nice and sweet you won't need added sugar. If you find your base needs to be sweetened up simply add in a little sugar or agave until you reach your preferred level of sweetness.

Yogurt Parfaits with Apricot-Glazed Berries,Instant Pot,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Yogurt Parfaits with Apricot-Glazed Berries,4 servings,  Yogurt: 3 3/4 cups (880 ml) whole milk  4 teaspoons whole-milk plain Greek yogurt (we used Fage Total; you may use any yogurt that has live and active cultures)   Parfaits:  2 tablespoons (40 g) apricot jam  1 tablespoon (15 ml) fresh lemon juice  8 ounces (225 g) fresh strawberries hulled and cut into pieces  6 ounces (170 g) fresh blueberries  1 cup (113 g) granola    , This recipe was designed for use with the 6-quart Instant Pot Ultra. NOTE: You can make more yogurt by using three 16-ounce (475 ml) canning jars (that is the most that can fit on the steamer rack without worry of it tipping over). Just fill the jars up leaving about  1/2 inch (13 mm) at the top and plan on a bit more refrigeration time.  To make the yogurt insert the steam rack into the Instant Pot®. Add 1 1/2 cups (350 ml) water. Divide the milk among four 8-ounce (235 ml) canning jars and place on the rack. Place the jar lids (but not the rings) on top of each jar (covering them will ensure that no condensation or steam will drip into the jars).   Lock the lid and press [Steam] and cook for 1 minute. Use the "Natural Release" method for 5 minutes then vent any remaining steam and open the lid.   Using oven mitts or canning tongs carefully transfer the jars to a wire cooling rack and remove the lids (alternatively leave the jars in the pot and carefully remove the lids). Let the milk cool stirring occasionally to 115 degrees F (46 degrees C). This will take at least 45 minutes (and likely double for 16-ounce or 475 ml jars; see Note left).   Once the milk in each jar has cooled to 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) spoon off and discard any skin that has formed on the top then stir 1 teaspoon Greek yogurt into each jar. Place the jars back into the pot and cover with the lids (but not the rings). Lock the lid. Press [Yogurt] and cook for 8 hours. When it is finished "Yogt" will appear on the display. Press [Cancel] then open the lid.   Remove the jars and use the rings to close the jars completely. Refrigerate until chilled at least 6 hours or overnight.   To make the parfaits in a medium bowl whisk together the jam and lemon juice. Add the strawberries and blueberries and toss to coat.   In glasses or bowls layer the yogurt with the granola and glazed berries.

A mix of six to eight different varieties some for tart some that hold their shape and some that don't will give you a pie with exceptional flavor and texture.  Slice the apples into  1/2-inch (1.5 centimeters) thick slices or chunk them up into pieces you can comfortably get into your mouth.  In a large mixing bowl put the apples sugar salt cinnamon nutmeg allspice vinegar calvados and flour and mix lightly until most of the surfaces are covered with what looks like wet sand.  Pour the mixture into an unbaked piecrust mounding high and dot with butter.  Roll out the remaining dough lay it over the fruit and cut 5 to 6 vents on top.

Classic Strawberry Shortcakes,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Classic Strawberry Shortcakes,8 shortcakes,   1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter  3/4 cup milk 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 cup plus 5 tablespoons sugar 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  3/4 teaspoon salt 6 cups (2 1/2 pounds) fresh ripe strawberries 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream   , These big pillowy shortcakes are tender and slightly sweet. Split in half and filled with juicy strawberries they are topped with softly whipped cream for a gorgeous dessert. Ripe flavorful strawberries are essential for this dessert as is sugaring them beforehand to let the natural juices come out.  Cut the cold butter into small cubes and refrigerate for 10 minutes. Put the milk in a cup add 1 tablespoon of vanilla to it and refrigerate it as well. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Put the flour  3/4 cup sugar baking powder and salt in a large bowl and whisk until blended. Scatter the cold butter pieces over the dry ingredients and toss them with your hands until they are coated. With a pastry blender cut the butter into smaller and smaller pieces. If chunks of cold butter get stuck in the wires of the pastry blender use a table knife to push them off then continue cutting. You are done when the biggest butter pieces are not larger than green peas. Some will be much smaller and that's fine.  Pour the chilled vanilla milk into the flour and butter then stir with the fork 12 to 15 times until it holds together in big shaggy clumps. Sprinkle your work surface with a little flour. Turn the clumpy mass out onto the floury surface and knead it gently 4 to 8 times until it comes together into a dough. Don't knead too long or the shortbread will be tough.  Pat the dough into an 8 by 4-inch rectangle. Be sure it is the same thickness everywhere. Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise and then into quarters crosswise. You should have 8 pieces each about 2 inches square. Brush off any extra flour from the top and bottom of the shortcakes and place them several inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Just after you slip the shortcakes into the refrigerator position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 425&deg;F.  Bake for 14 to 16 minutes until golden brown on top and firm to the touch. Transfer the pan to a cooling rack. Let the shortcakes cool completely.  Place the berries in a sieve or colander under cool running water. Look through them and discard any moldy berries. Drain well and pat dry with paper towels. Remove the leafy green tops from the strawberries. Cut the strawberries into  3/4-inch-thick slices. Put the berries in a medium bowl sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of sugar and toss. Stir every few minutes. As the berries sit the sugar will draw out some of their juices and make a tasty syrup in the bottom of the bowl.  Put the cream the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and the remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla in a medium bowl. Whip the cream until it holds medium-firm peaks when the whisk or beaters are lifted. It should look silky. If you whip the cream too long and it looks grainy lumpy or curdled pour in 3 or 4 more tablespoons cream and stir in gently (no more whipping). It should smooth out nicely. Cover until needed.  Cut each shortcake in half. Put one of the bottoms cut side up on each plate. Spoon the strawberries and syrup over the bottoms dividing evenly. Place a large spoonful of whipped cream on top of each mound of strawberries. Set the biscuit tops cut sides down on the cream. Serve right away.

New York Style Cheesecake,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/New York Style Cheesecake,1 serving,  1 tablespoon unsalted butter melted 5 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs 2 pounds cream cheese 1  3/4cups sugar 4 large eggs room temperature 1 lemon zest of 2 teaspoons vanilla extract  3/4 cup heavy cream  3/4 cup sour cream   , This firm and dense cheesecake does not require the water bath usually used to evenly cook cheesecakes.  The initial burst of high heat causes the eggs to puff then the quick reduction to 200  degrees F prevents the eggs from over cooking and allows the cake to slowly dehydrate creating the dense yet creamy texture expected from a New York Style cheesecake.   Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 500 degrees F.  Brush the bottom and sides of a 9-inch spring form pan with butter.  Sprinkle graham cracker crumbs over bottom.  Tilt pan in all directions to coat evenly with crumbs.  Set aside.  Beat cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer until smooth.  Gradually add sugar and beat on medium speed until sugar dissolves about 3 minutes.  Add eggs one at a time beating until just incorporated and scraping down after each addition.  (If you don’t scrape down the bowl after each egg you will have cream cheese lumps).  Add zest and vanilla and beat until just incorporated.  Remove bowl from mixer and stir in cream and sour cream by hand.  Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake cake at 500 degrees  for 10 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees  (leave oven door open until oven temp reduces).  Bake until cheesecake perimeter is set but center jiggles like Jell-o when pan is tapped about 1 hour.  Turn off heat and leave oven door ajar using a long-handled wooden spoon to hold it open for 1 hour longer.  This gradual cooling will prevent the top from cracking.  Remove cheesecake from oven and set on a wire rack; cool to room temperature.  Cover and refrigerate until chilled at least 4 hours.  (Can be refrigerated up to 4 days.)  May be served with fruit topping if desired.

Fresh Fig and Lemon Preserves,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/breakfast/jams-preserves/Fresh Fig and Lemon Preserves,2 (2 1/2-pint) jars,  1 medium lemon 2 cups sugar 2 pounds black or green figs stem ends removed   , The plump Brown Turkey figs that Amy Hicks brings to farmers' markets for customers of Amy's Garden would be luscious in this easy jam but any fresh figs will work. A finely chopped lemon minus the seeds helps balance the figs' honeyed sweetness. Serve on English muffins toast or biscuits or as an accompaniment to blue cheese.  Fill a canning kettle with enough water to cover the top of widemouthed canning jars (half-pints or mix of pints and half-pints) resting on the preserving rack. Bring to a boil. Wash the jars with hot soapy water; rinse well and keep upside down on a clean dish towel until you are ready to fill them. Put new lids (never reuse lids) in a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water.  Remove the tips of the lemon and quarter it lengthwise. Cut away the white core. Pick out and discard any seeds. Cut the quarters in half and put them in a food processor with 1 cup of the sugar. Process as fine as possible. Add the figs and process until they are well chopped but not fully pureed. It is nice to leave the preserve a little coarse.  Transfer the contents of the processor bowl to a large nonreactive pot and stir in the remaining 1 cup sugar. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat stirring then simmer gently until the temperature reaches 200 degrees F on an instantread thermometer about 15 minutes. You can also test for doneness by spooning a small amount of jam onto a chilled saucer. Return the saucer to the freezer until the jam is cold then test to see if it has the consistency you like. It should be neither soupy nor stiff.  Ladle the hot jam into the jars leaving  1/2" headspace. Wipe the jar rims clean with a damp paper towel. Top with the lids and then a screw band. Close tightly.  Place the jars on the preserving rack and lower it into the canning kettle. If the water doesn't cover the jars add boiling water from a tea kettle. Cover the canning kettle.

Farro Risotto with Butternut Squash with Kale Chips,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/pasta-grains-legumes/Farro Risotto with Butternut Squash with Kale Chips,4 servings,  1 medium (2 pound) butternut squash peeled seeded and cut into 1-inch dice  3/4 cup olive oil plus more as needed  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  2 cups kale ribs removed and cut into 1-inch pieces 1 tablespoon olive oil  1 cup farro semi pearled or whole rinsed 2 cups boiling water 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 medium shallots minced 2 cloves garlic finely minced 1 teaspoon fresh oregano minced  1/2 cup dry white wine 5 cups vegetable or chicken stock 2 tablespoons grated pecorino romano 2 teaspoons lemon zest   , Farro with its complex nutty taste looks similar to a grain of brown rice. As this grain contains starch similar to Arborio rice it behaves similar to risotto releasing a creamy binding liquid when cooked. Unlike risotto it becomes tender and has a distinct bite. Because farro is so easily digested and so low in gluten farro can often be eaten by people who are gluten intolerant.   Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and position an oven rack in the upper third.   In a large heatproof bowl pour boiling water over farro and cover. Allow to sit undisturbed for about 20 minutes.  To cook squash: Place the squash in a large bowl and toss with olive oil until all pieces are well coated. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the squash in an even layer on a silpat-lined baking sheet. Cooked squash has a tendency to stick to parchment paper. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast until golden-brown and tender about 30 minutes.   To prepare kale chips: Place the kale in a medium bowl toss with olive oil and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until crisp and slightly browned around the edges. Sprinkle with salt while warm and allow to cool completely.   In a large saute pan melt butter in the olive oil over a medium high heat. Add the shallots and cook until translucent about 2 minutes. Add garlic using a wooden spoon to stir and cook until fragrant approximately 30 seconds. Stir in the fresh oregano.   To prepare farro: Add the drained farro to the pan stirring to coat the grains in the oil and butter until toasted about 2 minutes. Add the white wine to deglaze the pan and reduce the heat to low and bring the liquid to a simmer.  Begin adding the stock stirring well with each new addition in  3/4 cup intervals. Adding the additional stock as the pan becomes dry and you can see a line in the pan when moving a spoon through the farro. After approximately 3 cups of stock have been added taste farro for doneness. It should be chewy yet tender. Add additional stock as needed. Stir in grated pecorino romano and lemon zest when farro is cooked.   Add the butternut squash to the cooked farro using a silicone spatula to fold the squash through the risotto and being careful not to mash the squash. Taste and season with salt and pepper.  To serve: Divide the farro between 4 warmed pasta bowls. Top with kale chips and serve immediately.

Cinnamon Sugar Palmiers,Cindy Mushet,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Cinnamon Sugar Palmiers,about 35 palmiers,   1/2 recipe (about 1 1/2pounds) Homemade Laminated Dough Recipe Here 1 cup granulated sugar plus more as needed Ground cinnamon to taste   , Named (in French) for their resemblance to a palm frond palmiers are also called elephant ears or butterfly wings. Traditionally they are made with puff pastry that is rolled out in sugar rather than flour then folded with additional sugar thinly sliced and baked. Because they are sliced and laid cut side down on the baking sheet they expand sideways instead of upward resulting in "ears " that showcase the many layers contained in the dough. Here we prepare palmiers using laminated dough. Palmiers will keep for 2 weeks in an airtight container at room temperature.  Generously dust work surface with sugar. Place the dough in the center and sprinkle the top with sugar covering it completely. Roll into a 16x10-inch rectangle using additional sugar as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface.  Position the dough so that one of the long edges is parallel to the edge of your work surface.  Using a ruler and the back of a chef’s knife mark a line dividing the dough in half vertically where each half measures 8x10 inches. Using the ruler and knife again mark each half vertically into quarters (every 2 inches). Fold the two short edges toward the center bending them at the first mark and lining up the edges at the second mark in each half.  Repeat until the folded edges reach the center mark. Tighten each side to leave a 1/4 inch space down the center of the dough. Fold one side on top of the other forming a 10-inch long cylinder. If you look at an end of the cylinder you’ll see the shape of a heart. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Line the baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center. Place the remaining sugar in a small mixing bowl and stir together with cinnamon. Trim the ends of the cylinder if they are uneven or cracked then cut twelve  3/4-inch-thick slices from the chilled cylinder dip each side in cinnamon sugar and place 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Rewrap and return the cylinder to the refrigerator. Bake the cookies until golden at the edges 7 to 10 minutes. With a small metal offset spatula flip each cookie over. Return to the oven and bake until they are golden brown 9 to 12 minutes longer. Transfer to a rack and cool completely. Slice and bake the additional cookies (use new baking sheets each time to prevent palmiers from melting if using a straight out of the oven baking sheet) or freeze the remaining dough for another day. Serve on its own or with ice cream sorbet mousse or a cup of tea.  
Heirloom Apple Tart with Almond Filling and Calvados Cream,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Heirloom Apple Tart with Almond Filling and Calvados Cream,1 (9-inch) tart,  Tart Dough: 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar  1/2 teaspoon kosher or sea salt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter chilled in small pieces 3 tablespoons ice water  Almond Filling: 4 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature 4 ounces almond paste at room temperature crumbled 1 large egg at room temperature  3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour  Apple Filling: 1 pound apples peeled quartered cored and thinly sliced lengthwise 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter melted 2 tablespoons apple jelly or honey  Calvados Cream: 1 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sugar  3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 teaspoons Calvados or brandy or to taste   , Unlike the apple varieties sold in most supermarkets selected for their ability to store for months heirloom apples may not be good keepers. But when fresh off the tree as you will find them at farmers' markets and in CSA shares they have a perfume and juicy sweetness that few storage apples can match. If you have a choice taste first to find a variety whose flavor you like; with tart varieties you may want to sweeten with a little more sugar.  To make the tart dough: Put the flour sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse several times to blend. Add the butter and pulse until the bits of butter are no larger than a pea. Drizzle the ice water over the mixture and pulse until the dough begins to come together; it will be crumbly. Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and use the wrap rather than your hands to help you gather and shape the dough into a  3/4-inch-thick disk. Enclose with the plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it between 2 sheets of parchment paper at least 12 inches square. With a rolling pin flatten the dough into an 11-inch circle. To prevent sticking occasionally lift the top sheet of parchment and lightly flour the dough then replace the parchment and invert the dough so the bottom sheet is on top. Peel back that sheet of parchment and lightly flour the dough then replace the parchment and continue rolling.  When the circle is large enough fold it gently in quarters to make it easy to lift. Transfer it to a 9-inch tart tin with a removable bottom unfold it and gently press it into place. Roll the rolling pin across the top of the tin to remove any excess dough. Prick the dough in several places with a fork then place in the freezer for 30 minutes.  Baking the tart shell: Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F. To keep the tart dough in place as it bakes put a sheet of parchment paper in the tart shell and add enough pie weights or dried beans to cover the bottom of the shell and press up against the sides. Bake until the sides are golden brown about 25 minutes. Lift the parchment paper to remove the weights; the shell will still be pale on the bottom. Cool on a rack. Leave the oven on.  To make the almond filling: Put the butter and almond paste in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add the egg and beat until creamy. Add the flour and beat just until well mixed. Spread the filling evenly in the cooled tart shell.  To make the apple filling: In a large bowl toss the apples with the lemon juice to prevent browning. Sprinkle with the sugar and toss again. Arrange the apples over the filling in concentric circles working from the outside in and overlapping the slices slightly. Brush the apples with the melted butter.  Baking and serving: Bake until the filling is puffed and firm to the touch and the apples are browned on the edges about 40 minutes. Transfer to a rack.  While the tart is still hot warm the jelly in a small saucepan until it liquefies. Brush this warm glaze over the apples. Serve the tart warm. Cut the tart into wedges and serve a dollop of Calvados Cream alongside each serving.  Before serving make the Calvados  cream: In a bowl with a whisk or a handheld mixer beat together the cream sugar and vanilla until the mixture visibly thickens and begins to hold a shape. Whisk in the Calvados and drizzle over the tart.

This free-form fruit tart requires no special pan and is beautiful in its rustic simplicity. It is a versatile dessert that's terrific with any seasonal fruit.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and place a rack in the lower third. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.   Generously flour a work surface and place the chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll chilled dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until the circle measures 14 inches wide and  1/8 inch thick. Starting at one edge roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer to baking sheet. Chill crust while preparing the rest of the ingredients.  Peel core and slice apples in  1/8-inch thick pieces (for apples with a rosy tender skins leave unpeeled for an extra pop of color and texture). Transfer apples to a large bowl and add  3/4 cup sugar brown sugar flour spices lemon juice and salt; toss to evenly coat.   Mound the apple filling in the center of the chilled pastry crust leaving a 3-inch border and dot filling with the butter. Fold the border up and around the fruit. Working around the border pinch the dough together to make an attractive pleat. Brush the top of the pleated dough with beaten egg and sprinkle border with almonds and remaining tablespoon of sugar.  Bake crostata until crust is golden brown and bubbly 40 to 45 minutes. Use a metal spatula to lift the crostata slightly and check the underside of the crust which should be golden brown like the top. Transfer crostata to a rack to cool for 15 minutes. Slice and serve warm topped with vanilla bean gelato.  For the dough: This recipe produces a simple lightly sweetened crust that can be used with all types of fillings. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month.   Place flour sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor or large mixing bowl. By pulsing or using a pastry blender cut the butter into the flour until the butter is the size of small peas.   Sprinkle ice water a tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Pulse or stir mixture until large clumps form. When enough water has been added to allow the dough to hold together transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Gather the dough together to form a ball. Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.  
Authentic Italian Lasagna with Besciamella Sauce,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Authentic Italian Lasagna with Besciamella Sauce,8 to 12 servings,  1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 recipe Fresh Pasta Dough Click here for recipe Kosher salt 5 cups Bolognese Sauce Click here for recipe 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 2 cups Besciamella Sauce (below)   Besciamella Sauce-makes 3 cups: 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3 cups whole milk 2 teaspoons kosher salt   , Lasagna is the most famous and savory of all Italian baked dishes. Today it is made all over Italy but this rich and complex dish originated in the region of Emilia-Romagna specifically Bologna. The key to this dish is seasoning each layer with salt and pepper as you put together the dish.  For the Besciamella Sauce: Place the butter into a medium saucepan and place on the stove over a medium heat to melt. Once melted whisk in the flour until smooth and continue to cook until the flour turns a light golden color about 2 minutes.  Meanwhile heat the milk in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until simmering. Slowly pour the milk into the butter-flour mixture whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Simmer stirring often with a wooden spoon until the mixture has thickened about 15 minutes. Season with the salt and set aside.  For the Lasagna: Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F and position rack in the center. Grease a 9-inch by 13-inch baking dish with butter and set aside.  Heat a large pot of water over high heat until boiling. Add enough kosher salt to season the water to taste like sea water. While salted water boils vigorously add one sheet of the pasta at a time and cook until it floats to the surface 10 to 15 seconds. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and plunge into a large bowl of ice water to stop further cooking. Remove from the water when cool. Lay pasta sheets out being careful not to let them touch on clean damp kitchen towels and cover with more damp towels.  Line the bottom of a prepared baking dish with a layer of pasta trimming the sheets with a knife so that they fit in one even layer (patch if necessary). Spread evenly with 1 1/2 cups of the Bolognese sauce sprinkle lightly with some of the cheese and season with salt and pepper. Add another layer of pasta evenly spread 1 1/2 cups of Besciamella sauce on the pasta then sprinkle lightly with cheese season with salt and pepper. Repeat layers (you will have 3 layers of Bolognese sauce and 2 of Besciamella) ending with Bolognese sauce and Parmigiano. Reserve any extra Bolognese for another use.  Transfer the lasagna to the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees F and cook until the lasagna is bubbling around the edges and browned on the top about 5 to 7 minutes more. Do not overcook.   Allow the lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before serving.   
Farro Risotto with Sausage Fennel and Squash,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Farro Risotto with Sausage Fennel and Squash,4 servings,  5 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken stock 1 cup farro (imported Italian semi-pearled farro recommended)  2 cups boiling water 1 small (1 pound) butternut squash peeled seeded and diced into  3/4-inch pieces 1 medium fennel bulb trimmed cored and diced into  3/4-inch pieces  1/2 pound ground sweet or hot Italian sausage no casings   1/2 teaspoon ground fennel seeds  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil plus more as needed  2 large shallots minced 2 medium garlic cloves finely minced  1/2 cup dry white wine 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon fresh oregano minced 1 cup (2 ounces) grated Pecorino Romano plus more for garnish Juice of 1 medium lemon   , Farro has a complex nutty taste and looks similar to a grain of brown rice. Farro grains contain starch like Arborio rice so it behaves similarly by releasing a creamy liquid when cooked making it a great substitute in risotto. (Be aware that whole grain farro takes longer to cook than semi-pearled or pearled farro. Soak whole grain farro at least 4 hours or preferably overnight before cooking).   Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.   Pour chicken broth into a large saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and cover.   In a large heatproof bowl pour boiling water over farro and cover. Allow to soak for 20 minutes before draining off liquid.   To roast squash fennel and sausage: place the squash fennel sausage and ground fennel seeds in a large bowl and toss with enough oil to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to a baking sheet and place in the oven; roast until sausage is browned and squash is tender 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside.   For the risotto: in large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat add 1 tablespoon oil. When oil is simmering add shallots and garlic; cook until translucent about 2 minutes. Add drained farro stirring to coat the grains in the oil. Add wine and cook until pan is almost dry about 3 more minutes.   Using a ladle add about 1 cup of hot broth to the pan stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat to medium and cook until broth is almost fully absorbed. Add broth as needed  1/2 cup at a time stirring constantly and adding more stock only after the previous addition has been absorbed until the farro is tender about 20 to 30 minutes. (Adjust the heat so the farro simmers rapidly throughout the cooking).  When farro is tender stir in squash and sausage mixture butter oregano and grated cheese.

Serve with creamy Dijon potatoes lightly steamed green vegetables and some real French bread.  Reduce beef stock by half to create a rich double strength stock.   SERVES:  6 to 8 PREPARATION TIME:  20 minutes COOKING TIME:  2 1/2 to 3 hours COOK IN: 5 1/2 quart round oven or doufeu   Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over a medium heat.  Add the bacon lardons and cook until lightly browned.  Remove with a slotted spoon onto a plate (retaining the oil in the doufeu) and set to one side.  Fry the meat in 2 to 3 batches adding small amounts at a time and removing from the pan once lightly browned.  Add a little more olive oil between batches if necessary.  Return the bacon lardons and the removed beef to the round oven.  Add the wine a third at a time stirring well to release any caramelized juices from the base of the doufeu.  Stir in the garlic tomato paste beef stock carrots the bouquet garni and 2 teaspoons of black pepper.  Bring the contents to a simmer over a medium heat.  Once simmering reduce the heat to low put on the lid and cook for 2 hours.  Half an hour before the beef finishes cooking caramelize the shallots and mushrooms by melting 2 tablespoons of the butter in a skillet over a low to medium heat.

Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon.  Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the skillet add the mushrooms and gently fry until nicely browned.  After the 2 hours cooking time is over carefully remove the lid from the doufeu and discard any remaining water.  Remove the bouquet garni.  For the beurre manie blend the butter and flour in a small bowl.  Add to the sauce in small amounts stirring after each addition until it has all been incorporated whisking to remove lumps.  Stir in the caramelized shallots and mushrooms.  Simmer for 10 to15 minutes to reduce and thicken.  Stir well adjust the seasoning to taste and sprinkle with the parsley before serving.

Naturally Colored Fettuccine,Ashley Cuoco,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Naturally Colored Fettuccine, 4-6 (1 pound) per variety,  Beet Pasta: 6 ounces semolina flour plus more for dusting 4 ounces all-purpose flour 1 large egg 5 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 medium cooked beet peeled  Tomato Pasta: 6 ounces semolina flour plus more for dusting 4 ounces all-purpose flour 1 large egg 5 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon kosher salt 4 tablespoons tomato paste  Saffron Pasta: 2 teaspoons saffron threads  1/2 teaspoon turmeric 6 ounces semolina flour plus more for dusting 4 ounces all-purpose flour 1 large egg 5 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon kosher salt  Spinach Pasta: 6 ounces semolina flour plus more for dusting 4 ounces all-purpose flour 1 large egg 5 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon kosher salt 4 tablespoons frozen chopped spinach defrosted   , To make the beet pasta: Puree beet in a food processor or blender until smooth.  Pour flours directly onto a large work surface. Use your fingers to combine them and make a well in the center. Add whole egg egg yoks salt and beet puree. Use your hands or a fork to beat the center well gradually incorporating flour until the dough begins to hold together in a mass. If dough feels too dry add water by the teaspoon until it comes together. Sprinkle a handful of semolina onto your work surface. Knead the dough flouring as necessary until dough feels firm and elastic about 3 minutes. If dough feels too wet continue to add flour and knead until no longer sticky to the touch. Press dough into a disc and wrap in plastic—let rest at room temperature 30 minutes. Generously flour work surface with semolina. Use a bench scraper to divide disc into 4 equal portions. Remove one quarter and wrap the others in plastic. Set pasta rolling machine or attachment to widest setting (setting 1). Use a rolling pin to flatten the first quarter of dough into a rough rectangular shape about  3/4" thick. Dust in semolina and pass once dough through the roller. Fold dough like a letter and rotate 90 degrees. Flatten again with a rolling pin and pass once more through the widest setting. Dust with semolina and pass through the next narrowest setting (setting 2). Continue to dust and pass through the next narrowest setting until you reach setting 4 or 5 ideal thickness for fettuccine. When the sheet of dough becomes too long for your work surface divide it in two for more manageable sizes. Switch to a fettuccine roller. Dust sheets well with semolina and pass through on low speed. Catch strands in the center as they exit the roller; swirl well in semolina to keep from sticking. Using a circular motion gently twist the strands together to form a loose nest. Continue this rolling and cutting process with the remaining quarters of dough. At this stage nests are ready to be cooked in boiling salted water (2-3 minutes). Alternatively nests can be frozen on a sheet pan until firm and transferred to an air-tight bag for storage. When cooking from frozen add an additional minute or so of cook time.  To make the tomato pasta: Beginning with step 2 above follow the same instructions adding tomato paste (in place of the beet puree) to well with whole egg egg yolks and salt. Continue on through step 8.  To make the saffron pasta: In a small bowl add saffron threads and 3 tablespoons warm water. Stir and let soak about 5 minutes. Beginning with step 2 above follow the same instructions adding saffron threads and water (in place of the beet puree) to well with whole egg egg yolks and salt. Continue on through step 8.  To make the spinach pasta: Puree spinach in a food processor or blender until smooth. Using a paper towel or cheese cloth gently squeeze out a bit of the excess water (not all of it). Beginning with step 2 above follow the same instructions adding spinach puree (in place of the beet puree) to well with whole egg egg yolks and salt. Continue on through step 8.
