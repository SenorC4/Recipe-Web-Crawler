Pureed with onions and broth they make a velvety soup the color of ivory. Float crisp fried sage leaves on top for a dramatic garnish or top more simply with a sliver of butter and sprinkling of chives.  Peel the parsnips with a vegetable peeler and trim the thick stem end. Remove any part of the slender tip that is thinner than a pencil. Cut the trimmed parsnips into manageable lengths of about 3 inches and then quarter lengthwise. With a paring knife cut away and discard the hard central core. Cut the trimmed parsnips into  1/2-inch dice. You should have about 5 cups.  Melt the butter in a large heavy pot over moderate heat. Add the onion and celery and cook stirring often until the onion starts to color 7 to 8 minutes. Add the parsnips broth and thyme sprigs and bring to a simmer. Cover adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the parsnips are tender about 20 minutes.  Remove the thyme sprigs.
