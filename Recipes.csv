Choose large sturdy sprigs that are about 8 inches long.  Pull off most of the leaves from each sprig leaving a nice tuft of leaves at the top (use the remaining leaves in the dish you are making or reserve for another use).  Using a sharp knife cut off the bottom of the sprig on a diagonal to give you a sharp point.  The skewer will slide easily through the shrimp when you skewer them.  Toss the parsley and basil leaves into a food processor add the breadcrumbs salt pepper and &#188; cup of the olive oil and zap until the herbs are chopped and the bread crumbs look green.  Transfer to a pie plate or wide shallow bowl add the shrimp and toss to coat well.  Skewer 4 or 5 shrimp on each rosemary sprig (the easiest way to do this is line up 4 or 5 shrimp at a time on a work surface and run a skewer through them; then separate them slightly so they will cook evenly).  Dredge on both sides in the bread crumb mixture place on a platter and put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Preheat a gas grill or prepare a fire in a charcoal grill.  Put a piastra on the grill to preheat.  Spritz or brush the piastra with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Place the skewers on the piastra and cook turning once just until the shrimp are opaque throughout and some of the crumbs are browned 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a serving platter and serve with the lemon wedges.

Pureed with onions and broth they make a velvety soup the color of ivory. Float crisp fried sage leaves on top for a dramatic garnish or top more simply with a sliver of butter and sprinkling of chives.  Peel the parsnips with a vegetable peeler and trim the thick stem end. Remove any part of the slender tip that is thinner than a pencil. Cut the trimmed parsnips into manageable lengths of about 3 inches and then quarter lengthwise. With a paring knife cut away and discard the hard central core. Cut the trimmed parsnips into &#189;-inch dice. You should have about 5 cups.  Melt the butter in a large heavy pot over moderate heat. Add the onion and celery and cook stirring often until the onion starts to color 7 to 8 minutes. Add the parsnips broth and thyme sprigs and bring to a simmer. Cover adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the parsnips are tender about 20 minutes.  Remove the thyme sprigs. Let the soup cool slightly then puree in a blender or food processor until smooth in batches if necessary. Return the soup to a clean pot and reheat to serve thinning to the desired consistency with additional broth. Season with salt and pepper.  While the soup reheats prepare the garnish.

Grilled Eggplant Cannelloni with Ricotta and Prosciutto,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/main-courses/vegetarian/Grilled Eggplant Cannelloni with Ricotta and Prosciutto, 4 servings,2 large globe eggplants 1&#188; to 1&#189; pounds each Kosher or sea salt 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  Tomato Sauce: &#188; cup extra virgin olive oil &#189; yellow onion minced 2 large cloves garlic minced 1&#189; pounds plum (Roma type) tomatoes chopped (no need to peel) 8 to 12 fresh basil leaves 1 teaspoon dried oregano Pinch of hot red pepper flakes Kosher or sea salt  Ricotta Filling: 2 cups whole-milk ricotta cheese (or one 15-oz. container) &#189; cup freshly grated pecorino or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese 1/3 cup minced prosciutto 2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley 1 large clove garlic minced Freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg lightly beaten  &#189; cup freshly grated pecorino or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese for topping   ,Lengthwise slices from a large eggplant become supple when grilled so you can roll them around a ricotta filling as if you were making cannelloni from pasta squares. Blanketed with a homemade fresh-tomato sauce and baked until bubbly and a little crusty around the edges the fork-tender bundles of stuffed eggplant are the ultimate Italian comfort food.  Slice off the eggplants' green cap then cut each eggplant lengthwise into slices about 1&frasl;3 inch thick. Discard the first and last slices which are mostly skin. You should get at least 6 large slices from each eggplant. Sprinkle them generously on both sides with salt then set the slices on a rack and let stand for 30 minutes. Moisture will bead on the surface.  Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium (375&deg;F). Pat the eggplant slices dry with paper towels then brush on both sides with the olive oil. Place the slices directly over the coals or gas flame and cook turning once until they are nicely marked by the grill and pliable about 3 minutes per side. They do not need to be fully cooked as they will cook further in the oven. Set the slices aside on a tray to cool.  To make the tomato sauce heat the olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut&#233; until the onion is soft and beginning to color 5 to 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook stirring often until they soften and collapse into a sauce about 10 minutes depending on ripeness.  Remove from the heat and pass the mixture through a food mill fitted with the fine disk. Return the puree to the skillet over moderate heat. Tear the basil leaves in half and add to the skillet along with the oregano (rubbing it between your fingers as you do) the hot pepper flakes and salt to taste. Simmer gently stirring occasionally until the sauce is thick and tasty. Set aside.  To make the ricotta filling put the ricotta pecorino prosciutto parsley and garlic in a medium bowl. Stir until blended then season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the egg.  Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Choose a shallow baking dish large enough to hold all the eggplant rolls snugly in one layer. Spread 1&frasl;3 cup of the tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish.  Put a generous 2 tablespoons filling on each eggplant slice and spread it evenly. Carefully roll each slice like a jelly roll and place the rolls seam side down in the baking dish. Top with the remaining tomato sauce spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the pecorino evenly over the top. Bake until lightly browned and bubbling about 45 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes before serving.   
Bourbon Peach Pie,Ashley Cuoco,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Bourbon Peach Pie, 1 pie; serves 8,Pie Crust: 2&#189; (12&#189; ounces) cups all-purpose flour &#189; teaspoon kosher salt 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter cold cut into &#189;-inch cubes &#8531; cup ice water  Bourbon Peach Filling: 4 pounds peaches peeled pitted and sliced &#8539;-inch thick &#189; cup granulated sugar &#188; to &#8531; cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon bourbon 2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon &#188; teaspoon ground nutmeg 2 tablespoon unsalted butter cut into &#189;-inch cubes 1 egg lightly beaten Turbinado or coarse vanilla sugar   ,To make the dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring with the fork.   Gather the clumps of dough together on the work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.   To make the filling add peaches flour sugar lemon juice bourbon vanilla salt and spices to a large bowl. Stir with a large spoon until peaches are evenly coated.  Preheat oven to 375&#176;F. Remove dough from the refrigerator and split in half. Place first half on a well-floured surface. Keep the second half chilled until ready to roll. Roll out the first half until it is roughly 10&#34; in diameter. Lay into a 9 &#34; metal pie dish and press into place.  Roll out the remaining half of dough in the same manner. Using a pastry wheel and a 1&#34; ruler as a guide cut strips of dough and set on a well-floured baking sheet.  Pour filling into pie dish and dot with cubed butter. Add lattice dough strips and trim all rough edges leaving about a 1&#34; border. Tuck the perimeter of the dough underneath itself to create a crustâcrimp with your thumb and index fingers all the way around the pie.  Brush dough with the beaten egg and top with sugar. Bake pie on a parchment-lined baking sheet 60-70 minutes until golden brown and bubbling. Let cool at least 1 hour before slicing.

Otherwise put a sheet tray upside down (to create a flat surface) on the middle rack. Heat oven to 450&#176;F.  Top the pizza: Gently press down on the dough with your fingertips pushing it to the edges. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper.

Tagliatelle Carbonara with Crispy Mushrooms Recipe,Molly Krebs,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Tagliatelle Carbonara with Crispy Mushrooms Recipe, 4 servings,2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks 1&#189; cups finely grated parmesan cheese divided plus extra for serving &#188; teaspoon salt &#188; teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 8 slices thick-cut bacon chopped &#188; cup extra virgin olive oil 1 pound wild mushrooms sliced 1 pound tagliatelle pasta &#189; cup reserved pasta water 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 1-2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley	 Fresh basil leaves for serving   ,In a medium mixing bowl whisk together the eggs egg yolks 1 cup of the parmesan cheese salt and pepper until smooth. Set aside while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the chopped bacon. Cook for 8 minutes or until bacon is golden brown and crispy. Remove bacon from pan and add to a paper towel lined plate. Pour bacon fat into a small bowl leaving 1-2 tablespoons in the pan for the mushrooms. Save the reserved bacon fat for the sauce later. Meanwhile bring a pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.  Add &#188; cup olive oil to the skillet with the 1-2 tablespoons of bacon fat. Heat over medium-high heat and once hot add the mushrooms and a few cracks of freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 12-15 minutes tossing the mushrooms only a few times so that they get deeply golden and crispy. Once they're finished season with salt and stir in the chopped rosemary. Remove mushrooms from pan and set aside. Add the reserved bacon fat to the skillet so that it's ready for the pasta!  At this point your pasta water should be boiling. Add your pasta and cook according to package directions or until just al dente. Remember to reserve your pasta water (I just scoop a bunch out with a large mug or heat-safe glass measuring cup!) Drain pasta and quickly pour it back into the pan with the bacon fat. Quickly add the egg-parmesan mixture and a splash of pasta water (start with 1/4 cup) and working quickly using tongs toss the pasta to combine it with the mixture to create a creamy "sauce". Add the remaining 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and keep tossing until melted and combined. Add a splash or so more of the pasta water (up to the remaining &#188; cup) if it seems like it needs more moisture. Season with freshly cracked black pepper. You most likely won't need any salt since bacon and parmesan are salty enough on their own! Add chopped fresh parsley and toss once more. Top with the crispy mushrooms. Serve immediately with extra grated parmesan and fresh basil.

Homemade Potato Dough,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/breads/dough/Homemade Potato Dough,1,1 small (5 ounces) russet potato peeled and quartered 1/2 tablespoon active dry yeast 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar 1/2 stick (2 ounces) unsalted butter room temperature plus more for greasing 1/2 cup (4 ounces) whole milk warmed to 110 to 115&#176; F 1 large egg room temperature 2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) bread flour or all-purpose flour plus more  1 teaspoon kosher salt   ,Bread bakers have been using potatoes (and potato cooking water) for many years. Yeast loves the starchy carbohydrates in potatoes and their lumpy texture adds not only flavor and moisture but also a chewy softness - ideal for dinner rolls. Serve these at a family dinner and watch them disappear.   1. To prepare potatoes:   To a small saucepan add potatoes and cover with cold water. Set saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook until potatoes can be easily pierced with a knife about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and reserve 1/2 cup of cooking water. Return potatoes to pan and using a potato masher or fork mash until smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature.  2. To prepare dough:    To a small saucepan set over medium heat add reserved potato water. Heat water to 110 to 115&#176; F and pour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar and whisk by hand to blend. Allow mixture to sit until yeast is activated and foamy or bubbling about 5 to 10 minutes.   3. To stand mixer bowl add 1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) mashed potatoes. Add remaining sugar softened butter milk and egg; whisk by hand until well blended. Add flour and salt and mix on low speed until dough begins to come together about 2 to 3 minutes. The dough will be sticky and wet. With mixer on low add additional flour a tablespoon at a time until dough begins to pull away from sides of bowl. Turn speed to medium-low and continue to knead until dough feels firm dense and springy about 5 to 6 minutes. Note: This dough is soft and sticky and will not pull away from the sides completely. Do not over-knead or starch from potatoes will break down and make dough gooey.  4. Lightly butter a large mixing bowl. Transfer dough to bowl and lightly coat surface of dough with a little softened butter. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let dough rise until doubled in size 45 to 60 minutes (longer if room is cold).   5. To cold-proof dough:  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press down on dough firmly to expel some air bubbles. Return dough to mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Transfer bowl to refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.

Glazed Lemon Yogurt and Olive Oil Pound Cake,Aran Goyoaga,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Glazed Lemon Yogurt and Olive Oil Pound Cake, 1 LOAF,r the cake  1 cup (200 g) sugar 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest (from 2 to 3 medium lemons)  1 cup (140 g) superfine brown rice flour 1 cup (100 g) almond flour any lumps broken up 3 large eggs &#189; cup (115 g) whole-milk yogurt or Cashew-Coconut Yogurt  &#189; cup (110 g) extra-virgin olive oil plus more for greasing 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon baking powder &#189; teaspoon kosher salt    For the glaze  2 cups (240 g) powdered sugar 2 to 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 tablespoons finely chopped pistachios for topping   ,This is the basic snack cake of my childhood. I would come home from school to find it displayed on an old red melamine tray cooling on the outdoor balcony. It is very lemony and moist with a simple glaze. You can add orange zest or poppy seeds to it if you&#8217;d like.  1.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the inside of an 8&#189;-by-4&#189;-inch loaf pan with a little bit of olive oil.  2.    To make the cake in a large bowl rub together the sugar and lemon zest until fragrant. This helps release the natural lemon oil. Whisk in the remaining ingredients until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes then invert onto a wire rack. Let the cake cool completely if you want the glaze to stay thick on top of the cake. If the cake is warm the glaze will melt and run off.  3.    To make the glaze in a medium bowl whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth and lump free. As you begin to whisk it might seem too thick but as the sugar absorbs the juice the glaze will thin out. The glaze should be pourable but not too runny.   4.    Put a tray or baking sheet under the wire rack and pour the glaze all over the cake letting it run over the edges. Wait a few minutes for the glaze to set. Sprinkle the top with the pistachios then serve. The cake will keep at room temperature for 3 days. If you refrigerate it the glaze will soften.  &#169;2021 by Aran Goyoaga.

Basil and fish sauce are both added at the beginning and the end of cooking to build a great depth of flavor in this Thai-style dish. If you&#8217;re using Thai chiles are extremely hot; you can reduce the heat by removing the seeds before adding them to this dish.   To marinate shrimp: Place shrimp 1 tablespoon fish sauce and 1 tablespoon lime juice into a medium mixing bowl and toss until thoroughly coated in the marinade.  Cover and refrigerate shrimp for 10 minutes.  To cook shrimp: Place oil in a large wok or skillet on the stove over moderate heat.

Sous Vide Asparagus,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Sous Vide Asparagus, 4 servings,1 pound asparagus 1 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (gallon) Ziploc bags   ,The color and flavor of cooking vegetables using sous-vide technology is unparalleled to standard cooking methods. Sous vide cooking allows us to cook at a temperature a bit below the boiling point of water so there is less risk of under/overcooking your vegetables. Furthermore sealing the vegetables before cooking in a water bath helps retain the natural plant sugars which would otherwise be diluted into a large volume of cooking water. That means brighter color and fuller flavor every time.  When we tested cooking asparagus in the Sansaire circulator we discovered that the vegetables contained more liquid and fibrous properties than proteins and therefore floated. Additionally when we compared cooking the asparagus lying flat in a bag with asparagus bunched at the bottom of the bag the asparagus which was cooked lying flat yield better color and flavor.  Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device&#8217;s owner&#8217;s manual for proper food-handling and safety procedures.    Choose a container large enough to hold your food with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the container using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator to 132 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.  Using a vegetable peeler peel the asparagus from the tip towards the base.   Line up the asparagus on a cutting board with the bottom of the Ziploc bag as your guide to how long your asparagus should be cut. Using a sharp knife carefully cut the asparagus so that the lengths are about the same size as the bag to enable the asparagus to snuggly fit into the bag.   Season the vegetables lightly with oil salt and pepper. Place the asparagus into the Ziploc bag so that the bottom of the asparagus is flat within the bag. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the vegetables. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag and leave the asparagus to circulate in the water until the vegetables are tender about 40 minutes.  To serve: Using tongs carefully remove the asparagus from the Ziploc bag into a warmed platter and serve immediately.

Peas and Ham Farro Risotto,by All-Clad,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Peas and Ham Farro Risotto, 4 servings,2 tablespoons olive oil 2 leeks trimmed and sliced thin 8 ounces cooked ham steak diced 1 cup farro rinsed 3 cups reduced-sodium chicken or vegetable broth 1 cup frozen peas &#189; cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Salt and black pepper   ,Heat olive oil in the All-Clad 8.4 qt.

Polenta with Broccoli Rabe and Fried Eggs,Dinner,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Polenta with Broccoli Rabe and Fried Eggs, 6 servings,1&#190; teaspoons kosher salt plus more as needed 1 bay leaf 1&#189; cups polenta 4 tablespoons (&#189; stick) unsalted butter 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 to 3 garlic cloves smashed and peeled 2 bunches broccoli rabe thick stems and wilted leaves trimmed Large pinch of red chile flakes 6 large eggs Freshly ground black pepper to taste Chunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for shaving   , This is one of my go-to I-don&#8217;t-feel-like-shopping dinners. Because I always have polenta and eggs in the house and usually there&#8217;s something green to saut&#233; I can make it when it&#8217;s stormy out or if I&#8217;m working late on a deadline or if I&#8217;d just rather go for a run than run to the store. You can substitute other greens like kale or spinach for the broccoli rabe; I do this often since they&#8217;re both regulars in my CSA box. Just note that spinach and kale cook up more quickly than the rabe so keep an eye on them. Or leave out the saut&#233;ed veggies altogether and serve the creamy polenta with a big crisp green salad&#8212;a perfect plan if your CSA leans harder on lettuces than braising greens.  In a medium pot combine 6 cups of water (or use broth if you prefer) 1&#188; teaspoons of the salt and the bay leaf. Bring to a simmer and then slowly whisk in the polenta. Stir frequently until the polenta has thickened enough that it no longer sinks to the bottom of the pot 5 to 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low cover the pot and simmer very gently until tender 15 to 30 minutes (depending on the coarseness of the grind). Remove the bay leaf and stir in the butter.  While the polenta is cooking place a 10- or 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and heat until it is shimmering. Stir in the smashed garlic and cook until it is golden brown and tender 3 to 5 minutes.  Toss the broccoli rabe and chile flakes into the skillet and cook until the leaves wilt and the stems just begin to color about 3 minutes. Season with the remaining &#189; teaspoon salt. Stir in &#188; cup of water partially cover the skillet and cook until the stems are tender about 10 minutes. If there&#8217;s liquid left in the pan take the cover off raise the heat and let it evaporate.  Transfer the broccoli rabe to a plate and wipe out the skillet if necessary. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and let it heat up. Crack the eggs into the skillet and season them with salt and pepper to taste. Fry the eggs sunny-side-up or flip them over for over-easy.  Spoon the polenta into bowls and top each serving with broccoli rabe and a fried egg. Use a vegetable peeler to shave curls of Parmigiano-Reggiano over the bowl.  Reprinted from Dinner: Changing the Game copyright &#169; 2017 by Melissa Clark.

Quick Coq au Vin,Jacques P&eacute;pin Poulets & L&eacute;gumes,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Quick Coq au Vin, 4 servings,1 chicken (3&#189;- to 4-pounds) or 2 whole boneless chicken legs plus 2 whole boneless skinless breasts 12 small pearl onions 2 tablespoons olive oil &#189; teaspoon sugar &#189; cup water 4 large mushrooms (4 ounces) cleaned and quartered &#8531; cup finely chopped onion 3 garlic cloves crushed and finely chopped (2 teaspoons) 1&#189; cups fruity dry robust red wine (such as Syrah or Grenache) 1 fresh thyme sprig or &#189; teaspoon dried thyme 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley &#190 teaspoon salt &#190; teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon potato starch dissolved in 2 tablespoons red wine  Croutons 4 slices firm white bread (4 ounces)  2 teaspoons canola oil   ,Traditionally coq au vin or chicken with red wine had to be cooked for a long time because the coq (&#34;cock&#34;&#8212;an older chicken) was tough. Now the dish can be made quickly with tender parts either cut from a young chicken or bought separately at the market. I divide the chicken into pieces remove the skin brown it and cook it in the red wine adding the breasts at the end so they donât get overdone. I glaze the onions separately in a little olive oil and sugar stirring the mushrooms in near the end. Finally I combine everything and serve it with large heart-shaped croutons.  If using a whole chicken cut off the wings and cut them at the joints into 3 pieces each. Cut the chicken into 4 pieces: 2 breasts and 2 legs. Skin and bone the breasts. Set the breasts aside with the 4 meatier wing pieces. (Freeze the bones and wing tips for stock if desired.)  To bone the chicken legs first pull off the skin and cut the tips off the drumsticks. Then cut down each side of the thighbone and slide your knife under the bone to separate the meat from it. Holding the thighbone cut all around the joint at the knee to loosen the meat. Scrape down the drumstick bone and pull out the bones. Set the legs aside with the breasts and wing pieces.  Put the pearl onions 1 tablespoon of the oil the sugar and the water in a large saucepan bring to a boil over high heat and boil until the water has evaporated and the onions start frying. Continue to cook stirring or shaking the pan occasionally until the onions are glazed on all sides. Add the mushrooms and saut&#233; for 1 minute. Set aside covered.  Preheat the oven to 400&#176;F.  Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet. When it is hot add the chicken wing pieces if you have them and saut&#233; for 2 to 3 minutes until lightly browned on all sides. Add the legs and brown for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Add the breasts and brown for 2 minutes on each side. Remove all the chicken pieces to a plate.  Add the chopped onion to the drippings in the skillet and saut&#233; for 1 minute. Add the garlic and cook for about 10 seconds. Add the wine thyme bay leaves salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Return the legs and the wings to the pan cover and boil very gently for 5 minutes. Add the chicken breasts and boil gently for another 6 minutes.  Add the dissolved potato starch to the chicken and stir until the pan juices are thickened. Add the pearl onions and mushrooms with their juices. Keep warm.  Croutons: Meanwhile trim the crusts from the bread and cut each slice diagonally in half to form 2 triangles. Trim each triangle into a heart-shaped crouton.   Spread the oil on a cookie sheet and press the croutons into the oil so they are moistened on both sides. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until nicely browned.  At serving time dip the top of each crouton into the sauce to moisten it and then into the chopped parsley. Cut the chicken breast pieces and legs in half serve 1 breast piece 1 drumstick or thigh and if you have them 1 piece of wing per person with 2 croutons along with some of the sauce and vegetables. Sprinkle the remaining chopped parsley over the chicken.

Spaghetti alla Chitarra,by Academia Barilla adapted by the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Spaghetti alla Chitarra, 10 servings,1 pound 10 oz. semolina 1&#189; pounds Caputo 00 flour 3 large eggs 1 cup water 35.2 oz. Tomato Sauce Academia Barilla 4 oz. Parmigiano-Reggiano Academia Barilla   ,Chitarra literally &#8220;guitar&#8221; is a wire-strung wooden frame used to make a rustic pasta called maccheroni alla chitara. The chitarra is used throughout the region of Abruzzo in central Italy. Never get your chitarra wet. Dust flour and any bits of dried pasta off the chitarra with a stiff brush or dry towel. The dough of maccheroni alla chitarra is a mixture of fine semolina and pasta flours.  Mound the flours in the center of a clean work surface. Mix together both flours and make a well in the middle of the flour add the eggs and water. Using a fork beat together the eggs and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well. As you incorporate the eggs keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. The dough will come together into a shaggy mass when over half of the flour is incorporated.   Start kneading the dough with both hands primarily using the palms of your hands. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Once the dough comes together in a cohesive mass remove the dough from the work surface using a bench scraper to scrape up all the dough. Lightly flour the board and knead for 5 minutes. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes remembering to dust your work surface with flour when necessary. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and set aside for 20 minutes at room temperature.  Roll out the dough through a pasta machine into very thin sheets (If using an Atlas Pasta Machine roll dough to number 5) then dry the pasta for a few minutes. To cut the pasta using the chitarra lay a sheet of pasta over the strings using a rolling pin and applying gentle pressure roll the pin over the pasta. Take your fingers run them down the chitarra crosswise to loosen the pasta.  Cook the pasta in a large pasta pot with salted broiling water. Drain and saut&#233; in a saucepan with Academia Barilla tomato sauce. Serve topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

With a sharp knife cut through the meaty portion between the ribs to separate them. There should be about 12 ribs. Place the ribs in a large bowl add 3 tablespoons salt and cold water to cover and stir to combine. Let stand for 30 minutes. Drain off the brining liquid rinse with cold water drain again and pat dry. Sprinkle lightly with additional salt and pepper.  Heat a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot enough for a drop of water to sizzle on contact. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and half of the ribs. Cook the ribs turning as needed and adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a steady sizzle for about 10 minutes or until evenly browned. Transfer the ribs to a plate. Repeat with the remaining oil and ribs.  Discard all but 1 tablespoon of the fat. Add the onion and green pepper and cook over medium-low heat stirring for about 10 minutes or until golden. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the paprika until blended. Add the tomatoes and broth and bring to a boil. Add the cinnamon red pepper and orange zest and stir to mix. Decrease the heat to low and cook uncovered for 5 minutes.  Transfer the ribs and any juices that have accumulated on the plate into the saucepan. Spoon the sauce over the ribs and cover. Cook over medium-low to low heat for 1 hour or until the meat is pulling away from the bones. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.  Add the beans and stir well to combine. Cook covered over low heat for 25 minutes or until the beans have taken on the flavors of the sauce.  Sprinkle the parsley over the ribs. Spoon the ribs beans and sauce into warmed shallow bowls and serve at once.
