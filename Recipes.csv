Yogurt Panna Cotta with Honey and Blackberries,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Yogurt Panna Cotta with Honey and Blackberries,6 (4-ounce) servings,Yogurt panna cotta:  1 envelope unflavored gelatin (2 3/4 teaspoons) 2 tablespoons cold water 1 cup heavy whipping cream  1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste 1 teaspoon lemon zest    1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 1 (17.6 ounce) tub of Greek yogurt such as Fage Total  2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  Roasted blackberries:  12 ounces fresh blackberries (about a pint) or frozen when fresh berries are unavailable  1 teaspoon lemon zest 3 tablespoons honey   ,This creamy yogurt panna cotta is topped with sweet roasted blackberries. When blackberries are at their best no need to roast just serve them with a drizzle of honey. For the rest of the year roasting is a great way to concentrate flavors and soften less-than-perfect berries.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F with rack positioned in the center.  For the panna cotta: In a small bowl sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water; let stand until softened 5 minutes. In a small saucepan over medium heat bring the cream sugar vanilla 1 teaspoon zest and salt to a simmer and then transfer to a medium bowl. Stir gelatin into cream until thoroughly combined. Add yogurt and lemon juice; whisk smooth. Divide mixture between 6 (4-ounce) ramekins and refrigerate until firm and chilled about 2 to 3 hours.  For the roasted blackberries: In a medium bowl toss berries and zest with honey. Spread berries out evenly in a large baking dish. Roast berries until juices are thick and reduced about 15 minutes. Transfer berries to a small bowl with pan juices set aside.    To serve: Run a paring knife around the inside of each ramekin. Set a plate over each ramekin and invert panna cotta onto a plate (you may have to tap and shake the ramekins to loosen the panna cotta). Spoon roasted blackberries over the top drizzle with some of the syrup and serve.   
Seared Salmon With Saffron Hollandaise,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Seared Salmon With Saffron Hollandaise, 4 servings,d salmon:   4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets pin bones removed Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon vegetable oil    Saffron hollandaise:  1/4 cup dry white wine 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 1 medium shallot minced 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1/8 teaspoon saffron threads steeped in 1 tablespoon warm water 3 large egg yolks 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter melted  Sea salt  2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice plus more as needed   1 tablespoon minced chives   ,To prepare the salmon: Season fillets generously on both sides with salt and pepper. To a large nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat add oil. When oil is shimmering add the salmon fillets flesh side down and sear on both sides until nicely browned and the flesh is no longer translucent in the thickest part of the fillet 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove salmon from skillet and place on a large plate; tent with foil to keep warm while you prepare the sauce.   To prepare the sauce: In a small saucepan combine wine vinegar shallots and peppercorns; cook until nearly dry. You should have about 1 tablespoon of liquid. Cool the reduction to room temperature then strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium heatproof bowl and combine with the saffron water.   To prepare the egg mixture: To a medium saucepan add water to reach 2 inches and bring to a simmer. Add egg yolks to the bowl with the reduction and place the bowl over the simmering water whisking constantly. To avoid overcooking the mixture be sure that the water is barely simmering with no visible signs of surface action just steam rising. As the egg yolks warm they increase in volume. If they become too warm and begin to coagulate around the sides and bottom remove from heat and cool slightly.  To prepare the hollandaise: When the yolks have tripled in volume and the mixture thickly coats the back of a spoon after about 5 minutes remove the bowl from the simmering water. Stabilize the bowl and begin adding the melted butter in a slow thin stream whisking constantly as it is incorporated. The sauce will begin to thicken as more butter is added. When the hollandaise is thick velvety and coats the back of a spoon add the lemon juice and taste and adjust seasoning with salt and additional lemon juice as needed. If too thick add a little warm water to thin the consistency.  If the sauce starts to break: It could be one of two things: either the butter was added too quickly or the egg mixture got too hot (scrambled eggs). To rescue a broken sauce try adding a small amount of boiling water and whisking until the sauce is smooth before adding more butter or add another egg yolk to a clean bowl and set back over simmering water; whisk until thickened and using a fine mesh strainer to catch the scrambled egg slowly strain the broken hollandaise gradually into the new egg yolk.  To serve: Place each salmon fillet on a warmed dinner plate and spoon hollandaise on top of each portion. Garnish with minced chives and serve immediately. 
Pan-Seared Scallops with Prosecco Butter Sauce,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Pan-Seared Scallops with Prosecco Butter Sauce,4 servings,2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil 1- 1/2 pounds sea scallops tough ligament removed from the side  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil if needed 1 small shallot minced 1 medium garlic clove minced 1 cup Prosecco   3/4 cup whipping cream 3 tablespoons unsalted butter cut into small pieces 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons chopped chives   ,These succulent scallops are perfectly accompanied with sweet yet slightly acidic Prosecco in a delicate buttery sauce.

To cook scallops: Place a large non-stick skillet over a high heat;  add canola oil and heat until the oil starts to shimmer. Carefully add the seasoned scallops to the skillet sear until browned on both sides and just opaque in the center-about 2 to 3 minutes per side depending on the size. Using tongs transfer the scallops to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.  To prepare the sauce: Return the skillet to the stove over a moderate heat and add the olive oil if the pan is dry. When the oil is shimmering add the shallots and cook until tender about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant about 1 minute. Add the Prosecco; bring the liquid to a boil and cook scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a silicone spatula. Pour in the cream and continue to cook until the mixture has thickened about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the butter a little at a time.  Stir in the lemon juice and chives taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

After all what's better than a day completely devoted to a delicious feast shared by family and friends all giving thanks for their blessings? This recipe takes an American classic to celebration status with a careful blend of spices and heavy cream outshining the stale spice mix and evaporated milk of less enchanting recipes. Ever notice how spices clump up and don't blend well when added to a custard? The trick is to blend them first with the eggs whose fat helps the clumps disperse evenly before adding any liquid to the custard mixture. 	 b>To prepare the pie crust: remove the dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll chilled dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until the circle measures 14 inches wide and  1/8 inch thick. Starting at one edge roll the dough around the rolling pin and lay it gently on top of a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie pan. Gently press the dough into the bottom and sides of the pan. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough so it overhangs the edge of the pan by 1 inch. Fold the overhanging dough under itself around the pan edge then crimp or form a decorative border. Chill the lined pan for at least 30 minutes.   Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and place a rack in the bottom third.   Prepare the pie for blind baking: line the chilled pie shell with heavy-duty foil pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 20 to 22 minutes until the foil comes away from the dough easily (if it doesn't then bake another 5 to 6 minutes and check again). Remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and lift out the foil and weights from the shell; set them aside to cool. Return the pan to the oven to continue baking the shell for about 10 minutes then remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and check to see if any cracks have formed. If you see a crack very gently smear a tiny bit of reserved dough over the crack to patch it-you need only enough to seal the opening. Return the pan to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer until the crust is a nice golden brown all over. Transfer to a rack and cool slightly. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees.  While the pie crust is baking make the filling: whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl to break them up. Add cinnamon ginger nutmeg cloves allspice and salt and whisk well to blend evenly. Whisk in the cream brown sugar granulated sugar and pumpkin and blend well. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer directly into the tart shell and bake until the custard is set about 30 to 40 minutes. Test by tapping the side of the pie pan-the center of the pie should look firm and move as one piece. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool completely about 2 hours.  Make the meringue: bring an inch of water to a boil in the bottom of the double boiler. Place the egg whites and sugar in the top of the double boiler off the heat. Set on top of the simmering water and whisk constantly (not vigorously just enough to keep the whites moving) for 4 to 5 minutes until the egg whites are hot to the touch and the mixture reaches 160-degrees on an instant read thermometer (the mixture should look frothy but not whipped). Remove the whites from the heat each time you test their temperature. When they are on the heat keep whisking to prevent scrambling. If that happens there is no recourse and you will have to begin again so watc

Rhubarb Curd,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Rhubarb Curd,1 serving, 3/4 pound rhubarb (about 6 stalks) cut into 1-inch chunks  3/4 cup plus  1/3 cup plus  1/8 cup sugar divided 4 egg yolks 3 tablespoons unsalted butter cut into chunks 1 teaspoon lemon zest 2 teaspoons lemon juice   ,Wash the rhubarb and trim as little off the ends as possible. In a small saucepan heat rhubarb  3/4 cup sugar and 4 tablespoons water over medium heat. Cook until the rhubarb falls apart adding water by the tablespoon if the rhubarb sticks to the bottom of the pan. At this point either use an immersion blender to puree the mixture or (if you're like me and your blender is otherwise occupied) push the mixture through a strainer-the first method is definitely easier.  Put a couple inches of water into the pot of a double boiler and set it over medium heat. Put the egg yolks the remaining  1/3 cup plus  1/8 cup sugar the butter lemon zest and lemon juice in the bowl of the double boiler and whisk to combine.

When all the rhubarb has been mixed in set the bowl over the pot; the water should be simmering. Stir for about 5 minutes until warm and slightly thickened. Remove from the heat. Press through a fine-mesh strainer-this will give your curd that smooth pudding-like texture-into a jar or other container with lid. Once cooled the curd will keep in the fridge for up to a week.

In Brittany the crepes are made with buckwheat flour and the typical filling is a smear of salted butter cheese ham or bacon thinly sliced fruit and/or eggs. In most of France crepes are rolled up or folded into half or quarter circles but in Brittany where they are sometimes called galettes they are folded differently. The filling is spread in the center of the pancake the four rounded sides are folded in over the filling forming a square and then the crepe is inverted onto a serving plate.  Make the crepe batter: in a large bowl stir together the buckwheat flour all-purpose flour and salt. in a small bowl whisk the eggs until well blended; stir in the water and butter. Gradually whisk the egg mixture into the flour mixture until the batter is smooth. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream. If it is too thick whisk in additional water 1 tablespoon at a time.  While the batter is resting prepare the filling: in a large skillet melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the onions increase the heat to medium and cook stirring for 5 minutes. Add the apples and cook stirring for 10 to 15 minutes until the apples begin to brown and have softened. Add the ham and sprinkle with the lemon juice nutmeg and salt. Cover and set aside until ready to fill the crepes.

Blot any excess with the tip of a paper towel. Stir the crepe batter well with the whisk. ladle about  1/3 cup of the batter into the heated pan and simultaneously tilt and roll the pan from side to side to coat the surface with a thin layer of batter. Cook for 1 minute or until the edges begin to set. run the tip of a small narrow rubber spatula under the edges of the crepe to loosen it from the pan. Use your fingertips to lift the crepe and quickly flip it over. Cook the other side for 30 seconds or until the batter is set into a thin pancake. Do not brown the crepe or cook it until crisp. Transfer the crepe to a large round plate. repeat with the remaining batter brushing the pan with more butter if necessary. Stack the crepes as they are made. You should have 12 crepes. if making ahead wrap the crepes in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent drying out. The crepes can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.  If the crepes have been made ahead fill them one at a time by first warming each crepe in the pan over low heat. While they are still in the pan sprinkle about  3/4 cup of the cheese in the center of the crepe. Top the cheese with a large spoonful of the warm apple filling spreading it into a single layer. Fold in two opposite sides of the circle to cover the filling. Then fold in the remaining two rounded sides overlapping slightly to form a square envelope. With a wide spatula lift the crepe from the pan and invert it so it is seam side down onto a serving plate. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm if not serving at once. Fill the remaining crepes in the same way. reserve the remaining filling.  Just before serving brush the smooth top of each crepe with a thin film of the softened butter. reheat the remaining apple filling and spoon a portion on top of each crepe. Serve at once.

Nectarine and Raspberry Galette,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Nectarine and Raspberry Galette,8 servings,Galette Dough: 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt  1/2 cup plus 7 tablespoons unsalted butter chilled cut into small pieces About  3/4 cup ice water  Filling: 1 1/2 pounds nectarines halved pitted and sliced lengthwise  1/2 pint raspberries 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 large egg yolk whisked with 1 teaspoon water for egg wash About 1 tablespoon sparkling sugar (coarse decorating sugar)   ,You can adapt this galette to other summer fruits such as apricots plums or berries. In the fall fill it with apples or pears. The beauty of a galette-a tart with a wide rim of dough folded over the fruit-is its rusticity. It should look like a grandmother not a pastry chef made it.  To make the dough: Put the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to blend. Add half the butter and pulse just until the fat is evenly distributed and coated with flour. Add the remaining butter and pulse a few times just until it is coated with flour. There should still be pieces of flour-coated butter about the size of large peas. Transfer the mixture to a bowl.   Drizzle in the ice water while tossing with a fork adding water just until the mixture begins to come together. Gather the dough with your hands and knead gently if necessary to get it to hold together. Resist the temptation to add more water. Handling the dough as little as possible shape it into a thick disk like a hamburger patty then wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. If you have a baking stone put it in the oven on the middle rack to preheat for at least 45 minutes.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 10 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. If it is too cold it will be brittle and difficult to roll. Unwrap the dough and place it between 2 sheets of parchment paper at least 16 inches square. With a rolling pin flatten the dough into a 15-inch circle.   To prevent sticking occasionally lift the top sheet of parchment and lightly flour the dough then replace the parchment and invert the dough so the bottom sheet is on top. Peel back that sheet of parchment and lightly flour the dough then replace the parchment and continue rolling.  When the circle is large enough remove the top sheet of parchment and transfer the dough still on the bottom sheet of parchment to a rimless baking sheet.   To assemble the galette: Working 2 inches from the edge of the dough place the nectarine slices in concentric rings. Scatter the raspberries evenly over the nectarines. Sprinkle the fruit with the granulated sugar.  Using a palette knife or other broad knife to help you lift the dough off the parchment gently fold the uncovered edge of the dough over the fruit to make a wide rough-edged rim. Make sure there are no cracks in the dough for juices to seep through. Brush the rim with the egg wash then sprinkle the rim with the sparkling sugar. With scissors cut off the exposed parchment paper. (It's okay if a little paper is exposed.)  Baking and serving: If you have a baking stone in the oven slide the galette still on the bottom sheet of parchment directly onto the stone. If you do not have a baking stone bake the galette on the rimless baking sheet. Bake until the crust is golden and the nectarines are juicy about 50 minutes. Slide the galette onto a rack to cool slightly. To serve slide it from the rack onto a cutting board and cut into wedges. Serve warm.

Classic Apple Pie,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Classic Apple Pie,1 (9-inch) pie,2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 10 tablespoons (1 3/4 sticks) cold unsalted butter cut into tablespoons 6 ounces cream cheese (not low-fat) at room temperature cut into  3/4-inch pieces  4 pounds Golden Delicious apples 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter divided  1/2 cup sugar divided plus 1 teaspoon  3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon heavy cream or whole milk   , The attractive high dome of an apple pie can be considered a ruse as the apples have shrunk leaving a big space between the filling and the crust. Precooking the apples will minimize the gap and concentrate the apple flavor too.  To make the dough put the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse briefly to combine them. Scatter the butter and cream cheese over the top and pulse about 12 times or just enough until the dough begins to clump together (butter pieces will still be visible). Turn the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and gather it together.  Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled but not hard 1 to 2 hours.  To make the filling: peel and quarter the apples and cut out the core from each quarter. Cut each quarter lengthwise into thirds and place in a large bowl. As you add the slices to the bowl occasionally sprinkle and toss the apples with lemon juice. (Don't wait until the apples are cut or the first slices will already have turned brown.)  In a large skillet melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add half the apples and  3/4 cup of the sugar. Cook stirring often for about 7 minutes or until the apples are barely tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Transfer to a large bowl or rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter the second half of the apples and another  3/4 cup sugar. If your skillet is smaller than 12 inches cook the apples in three batches. Let the filling cool completely stirring occasionally. Sprinkle the flour and cinnamon over the cooled filling and toss well.  Position a rack in the center of the oven and place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.   Lightly flour a work surface and draw a 12-inch circle in the flour. This guide will be the perfect size for a standard 9-inch pie dish. Place 1 dough disk in the center of the circle and dust a little flour on top. Using the circle as a guide roll out the dough into a 12-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over a 9-inch pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Fill with the apples.   Trim the overhanging dough to  1/2 inch. Roll out the remaining pie dough into a second 12-inch round. Transfer the dough round the same way centering it over the apple filling. Fold the overhang of the upper round under the edge of the bottom crust. Pinch the crusts together and flute the edge attractively. Cut a small hole in the center of the pie to allow steam to escape. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.  To bake and serve: lightly brush the top crust with the cream. Sprinkle the top crust with the remaining teaspoon of sugar. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake for 40 to 50 minutes until the top is golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Now pocket pies are all the rage again. These mini-pies featuring a delicious apple-cranberry filling are perfect for after-school treats or as a nostalgic addition to a dessert buffet. Any remaining filling can be frozen for future use.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees and place rack in the upper and lower thirds.   To prepare the apple-cranberry filling: Place all ingredients except raisins and walnuts into blender and pulse for 1 minute or until desired chunkiness is obtained. Place mixture in a bowl and stir in raisins and chopped walnuts.   To assemble pocket pies: Remove pie dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before rolling. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll chilled dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until dough is 1/8 inch thick. Using a 6-inch round cookie cutter cut 8 circles of dough rerolling once as needed. In a small mixing bowl whisk together egg and water for egg wash.  Place approximately 2 Tbsp. of the mixture in the center of each dough circle leaving a  1/2" border (avoid overstuffing dough as filling will leak out). Using a fingertip or small brush coat the dough edge halfway around with egg wash. Fold uncoated dough edge over to create a half-circle shape and press to seal and remove any air bubbles. Place assembled pocket pies on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray. Continue with remaining dough circles and freeze assembled pies for 30 minutes before baking. Save remaining egg wash.   Baking and serving: Remove pocket pies from freezer and cut a small "x " in the top of each with a sharp paring knife. Brush tops of pies with egg wash to coat. Sprinkle each with Demerra sugar and place pans in preheated oven. Bake until pocket pies are golden brown about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove pans from oven and allow pies to cool for 5 minutes. Using a large spatula transfer pies to a cooling rack.    Pocket pies can be served warm or room temperature.    Flaky Pie Dough:  Yield: 1 9- to 10-inch crust   To make the dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring.  Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.

Pasta with Baby Artichokes Mascarpone and Hazelnuts from Bon Appetit,by Bon Appetit,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Pasta with Baby Artichokes Mascarpone and Hazelnuts from Bon Appetit,ings,e only thing that makes in-season vegetables even better? Fresh pasta. The hardest part of making this recipe is trimming the artichokes which isn't as hard as it seems. If you can't get your hands on baby artichokes use the hearts of two globe artichokes.   12 oz. fresh lasagna sheets (about 8- x 6-inch)  All-purpose flour (for surface)  1 lemon halved 1 lb. baby artichokes (about 8)  3 garlic cloves crushed 2 bay leaves  3/4 cup plus 3 Tbsp. olive oil Kosher salt  3/4 cup blanched hazelnuts 2 Tbsp. finely chopped marjoram or oregano 1 1/2 tsp. Aleppo-style pepper 1 cup mascarpone 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice   ,Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Using a paring knife or a pastry wheel cut the sheet into quarters (each piece should be about 4- x 3-inch) then cut each piece on a diagonal from corner to corner to create 4 triangles. Transfer triangles to a flour-dusted baking sheet and cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat process with remaining lasagna sheets.   Squeeze juice from lemon halves into a large bowl of cold water. Working with 1 artichoke at a time pull off all the tough dark outer leaves until mostly yellow leaves remain. Using a serrated knife cut 1-inch off top of artichoke. Trim stem leaving at least  1/2-inch intact. Using a paring knife or a vegetable peeler remove dark green outer layer from stem. Cut artichoke in half lengthwise and then into  1/3-inch thick wedges. Drop artichoke pieces in lemon water. The acid in the water will keep them from turning brown while you trim the remaining artichokes.  Once all the artichokes have been trimmed drain and place in a wide medium saucepan. Add garlic bay leaves and  3/4 cup oil. Pour in cold water to submerge artichokes; season generously with salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until a paring knife slides through artichokes with little to no resistance 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool then drain and set artichokes aside.  While the artichokes are simmering away toast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet tossing once until golden brown 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool then coarsely chop. Toss in a medium bowl with marjoram Aleppo-style pepper and 3 Tbsp. oil; season with a generous pinch of salt. Set aside.  Mix mascarpone lemon zest and lemon juice in a separate medium bowl; season with salt. Set aside.  Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water stirring occasionally until very al dente. Drain reserving  1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid.  Return pasta and  3/4 cup pasta cooking liquid to pot and set over low heat. Add reserved mascarpone mixture and gently toss adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed if sauce is too thick until pasta is al dente and sauce coats pasta. Add reserved artichokes and half of reserved hazelnut mixture and gently stir to distribute (you want to avoid breaking up artichokes very much).  Divide pasta among bowls. Top with remaining hazelnut mixture.  Do Ahead: Hazelnuts can be toasted 3 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature. Artichokes can be trimmed and cooked 1 day ahead; let cool in cooking liquid. Cover and chill. Drain just before adding to pasta.

Prepare the tart shells and the cream filling ahead of time and assemble the tarts as you need them.  To make the dough: This recipe produces a simple lightly sweetened crust that can be used with all types of fillings. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month.  Place flour sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor or large mixing bowl. By pulsing or using a pastry blender cut the butter into the flour until the butter is the size of small peas.   Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Pulse or stir mixture until large clumps form. When enough water has been added to allow the dough to hold together transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Gather the dough together to form a ball. Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before using.    To make the tart: Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center of the oven.   b>To prepare the tart shell: Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and divide pie dough in four. Roll out each piece of pie dough into a circle with a 6-inch diameter. Fit dough circle into fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Bring the dough up the sides of the pan and trim any excess dough. Press dough gently into the flutes of the tin with the side of your finger to create a fluted edge. Repeat with remaining three pans. Transfer to the freezer until firm about 15 minutes.   To blind bake the tart shell: Line the chilled tart shell with heavy-duty foil pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 15 minutes until the foil comes away from the dough easily.  Remove the pan from the oven remove the foil and the pie weighs and prick the uncooked pastry base with a fork. Return pan to oven and continue baking the shell until the crust is golden-brown for about 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool.  To assemble the tart: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whip attachment beat the mascarpone cream and sugar until the mixture is smooth about 30 seconds. Stir in the orange juice and spread the mixture evenly across the bottom of the tart shells. Arrange the 8 fig quarters in each tart shell cut sides up fitting the figs tightly against the sides of the tart shell and each other. Arrange the raspberries in the center of the tart shell and drizzle the warmed honey all over the tart.  To serve: Remove the sides and bases of the tart pans and serve.

Blanketed with a homemade fresh-tomato sauce and baked until bubbly and a little crusty around the edges the fork-tender bundles of stuffed eggplant are the ultimate Italian comfort food.  Slice off the eggplants' green cap then cut each eggplant lengthwise into slices about 1&frasl;3 inch thick. Discard the first and last slices which are mostly skin. You should get at least 6 large slices from each eggplant. Sprinkle them generously on both sides with salt then set the slices on a rack and let stand for 30 minutes. Moisture will bead on the surface.  Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium (375 degrees F). Pat the eggplant slices dry with paper towels then brush on both sides with the olive oil. Place the slices directly over the coals or gas flame and cook turning once until they are nicely marked by the grill and pliable about 3 minutes per side. They do not need to be fully cooked as they will cook further in the oven. Set the slices aside on a tray to cool.  To make the tomato sauce heat the olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion is soft and beginning to color 5 to 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook stirring often until they soften and collapse into a sauce about 10 minutes depending on ripeness.  Remove from the heat and pass the mixture through a food mill fitted with the fine disk. Return the puree to the skillet over moderate heat. Tear the basil leaves in half and add to the skillet along with the oregano (rubbing it between your fingers as you do) the hot pepper flakes and salt to taste. Simmer gently stirring occasionally until the sauce is thick and tasty. Set aside.  To make the ricotta filling put the ricotta pecorino prosciutto parsley and garlic in a medium bowl. Stir until blended then season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the egg.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Choose a shallow baking dish large enough to hold all the eggplant rolls snugly in one layer. Spread 1&frasl;3 cup of the tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish.  Put a generous 2 tablespoons filling on each eggplant slice and spread it evenly. Carefully roll each slice like a jelly roll and place the rolls seam side down in the baking dish. Top with the remaining tomato sauce spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the pecorino evenly over the top. Bake until lightly browned and bubbling about 45 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes before serving.

SPINACH TAGLIATELLE,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/SPINACH TAGLIATELLE,rvings,3 ounces spinach washed and trimmed 1/2 teaspoon fine kosher salt plus more for salting water 1 large egg 1 large egg yolk 1 1/4 cups (6 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour plus more for dusting Semolina flour for dusting pasta and surfaces    ,Tagliatelle pappardelle tagliolini are just a few of our favorite hand-cut ribbon pasta. The only difference between the shapes is the width in which it is cut. Tagliatelle meaning “cut” in Italian is cut to 1/3-inch pappardelle to 3/4-inch and tagliolini to 1/8-inch. The general rule of thumb for the sauce is the wider the ribbon the heavier the sauce.   1. To blanch spinach:   Fill a large pot of water and bring to a rolling boil. Generously salt water. Add spinach to boiling water and cook until tender about 30 seconds. Using tongs transfer spinach to a colander and rinse under cold water. Thoroughly spin dry spinach in a salad spinner or wring dry in a clean kitchen towel.  2. To prepare dough: To the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade puree spinach. Add eggs and yolk to puree and process until well combined. Add flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and process until dough comes together about 20 seconds.  3. Transfer dough to well-floured surface. Knead dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky adding small amounts of flour as needed 6 to 8 minutes. Gather dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover in plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour at room temperature.  4. To roll out and cut dough:  Secure a pasta machine to edge of a long countertop. Using a bench scraper cut dough into 2 pieces. Keep extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with one piece. With a rolling pin or your hand roll or flatten dough into a rough rectangle that will fit inside widest setting of pasta machine. Roll dough through machine catching it with one hand as you roll with other. Take dough and trifold it like a letter. Turn dough so one open end faces machine and roll it through on widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting.   5. Continue rolling pasta through machine without folding adjusting rollers to a smaller setting each time. Roll out each sheet to second to last thinnest setting. If pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.   6. To shape the tagliatelle:  Liberally flour one sheet of pasta and loosely roll it into a cylinder. Using a sharp knife cut roll into 1/3" ribbons. Unwrap ribbons toss them with semolina flour and form into piles on baking sheets dusted with semolina. The pasta can be cooked immediately or covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use.   7. To cook the pasta: To a large pot of water set over high heat add water to 2/3 full and bring to a boil. Generously season water with salt. Add pasta and stir immediately to prevent tagliatelle from sticking together. Boil until al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain pasta through a colander. Use reserved pasta water to thin your chosen pasta sauce. 
Homemade Potato Dough,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/breads/dough/Homemade Potato Dough,1 serving,1 small (5 ounces) russet potato peeled and quartered 1/2 tablespoon active dry yeast 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar 1/2 stick (2 ounces) unsalted butter room temperature plus more for greasing 1/2 cup (4 ounces) whole milk warmed to 110 to 115 degrees  F 1 large egg room temperature 2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) bread flour or all-purpose flour plus more  1 teaspoon kosher salt   ,Bread bakers have been using potatoes (and potato cooking water) for many years. Yeast loves the starchy carbohydrates in potatoes and their lumpy texture adds not only flavor and moisture but also a chewy softness - ideal for dinner rolls. Serve these at a family dinner and watch them disappear.   1. To prepare potatoes:   To a small saucepan add potatoes and cover with cold water. Set saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook until potatoes can be easily pierced with a knife about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and reserve 1/2 cup of cooking water. Return potatoes to pan and using a potato masher or fork mash until smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature.  2. To prepare dough:    To a small saucepan set over medium heat add reserved potato water. Heat water to 110 to 115 degrees  F and pour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar and whisk by hand to blend. Allow mixture to sit until yeast is activated and foamy or bubbling about 5 to 10 minutes.   3. To stand mixer bowl add 1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) mashed potatoes. Add remaining sugar softened butter milk and egg; whisk by hand until well blended. Add flour and salt and mix on low speed until dough begins to come together about 2 to 3 minutes. The dough will be sticky and wet. With mixer on low add additional flour a tablespoon at a time until dough begins to pull away from sides of bowl. Turn speed to medium-low and continue to knead until dough feels firm dense and springy about 5 to 6 minutes. Note: This dough is soft and sticky and will not pull away from the sides completely. Do not over-knead or starch from potatoes will break down and make dough gooey.  4. Lightly butter a large mixing bowl. Transfer dough to bowl and lightly coat surface of dough with a little softened butter. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let dough rise until doubled in size 45 to 60 minutes (longer if room is cold).   5. To cold-proof dough:  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press down on dough firmly to expel some air bubbles. Return dough to mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Transfer bowl to refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.

Glazed Lemon Yogurt and Olive Oil Pound Cake,Aran Goyoaga,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Glazed Lemon Yogurt and Olive Oil Pound Cake,1 LOAF,r the cake  1 cup (200 g) sugar 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest (from 2 to 3 medium lemons)  1 cup (140 g) superfine brown rice flour 1 cup (100 g) almond flour any lumps broken up 3 large eggs  1/2 cup (115 g) whole-milk yogurt or Cashew-Coconut Yogurt   1/2 cup (110 g) extra-virgin olive oil plus more for greasing 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon baking powder  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt    For the glaze  2 cups (240 g) powdered sugar 2 to 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 tablespoons finely chopped pistachios for topping   ,This is the basic snack cake of my childhood. I would come home from school to find it displayed on an old red melamine tray cooling on the outdoor balcony. It is very lemony and moist with a simple glaze. You can add orange zest or poppy seeds to it if you'd like.  1.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the inside of an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan with a little bit of olive oil.  2.    To make the cake in a large bowl rub together the sugar and lemon zest until fragrant. This helps release the natural lemon oil. Whisk in the remaining ingredients until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes then invert onto a wire rack. Let the cake cool completely if you want the glaze to stay thick on top of the cake. If the cake is warm the glaze will melt and run off.  3.    To make the glaze in a medium bowl whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth and lump free. As you begin to whisk it might seem too thick but as the sugar absorbs the juice the glaze will thin out. The glaze should be pourable but not too runny.   4.    Put a tray or baking sheet under the wire rack and pour the glaze all over the cake letting it run over the edges. Wait a few minutes for the glaze to set. Sprinkle the top with the pistachios then serve. The cake will keep at room temperature for 3 days. If you refrigerate it the glaze will soften.  Copywrite 2021 by Aran Goyoaga.

Apricot-Bourbon Mustard,Sur La Table & Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/appetizers/dips-spreads-sauces-seasonings/Apricot-Bourbon Mustard,2 2/3 cups, 2/3 cup yellow mustard seeds 1 cup bourbon such as Maker's Mark  2/3 cup water  2/3 cup packed chopped dried apricots 4 tablespoons cider vinegar 4 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon kosher or sea salt   ,Do you have a Dagwood-style sandwich maker on your gift list one of those friends or a family member who loves nothing more than raiding the refrigerator and making a mile-high sandwich layered with meats and cheese and smeared with mayonnaise and mustard? This is the perfect gift-a unique homemade mustard blending the sweetness of dried apricots steeped in bourbon with the bright bite of whole mustard seeds.  Put the mustard seeds in a medium bowl and pour in 2/3 cup of the bourbon and all the water. Soak the mustard seeds overnight or for up to 24 hours.  At least 1 hour before you plan to make the mustard put the apricots in a bowl and pour in the remaining 1/3 cup bourbon. Macerate the apricots until most of the bourbon is absorbed (the apricots need to soak for a minimum of 1 hour or you can start soaking them at the same time you prepare the mustard seeds).  Before making the mustard wash the jars and lids in hot soapy water and dry thoroughly. Alternatively run the jars through the regular cycle of your dishwasher.  To make the mustard first strain the mustard seeds reserving the soaking liquid. Set aside the mustard seeds.  In a food processor fitted with the metal blade combine the apricots any unabsorbed bourbon remaining in the bowl cider vinegar honey and salt. Puree until almost smooth. Add the mustard seed soaking liquid and continue to puree until smooth. Add the mustard seeds and process until about half of the seeds are cracked and the others are incorporated but still whole.  Evenly divide the mustard among the prepared condiment jars leaving  1/2 inch headspace. Wipe the rims clean and secure the lids. Label and refrigerate for at least 2 weeks to allow the flavors to develop and mature.   
Sous Vide Asparagus,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Sous Vide Asparagus,4 servings,1 pound asparagus 1 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (gallon) Ziploc bags   ,The color and flavor of cooking vegetables using sous-vide technology is unparalleled to standard cooking methods. Sous vide cooking allows us to cook at a temperature a bit below the boiling point of water so there is less risk of under/overcooking your vegetables. Furthermore sealing the vegetables before cooking in a water bath helps retain the natural plant sugars which would otherwise be diluted into a large volume of cooking water. That means brighter color and fuller flavor every time.  When we tested cooking asparagus in the Sansaire circulator we discovered that the vegetables contained more liquid and fibrous properties than proteins and therefore floated. Additionally when we compared cooking the asparagus lying flat in a bag with asparagus bunched at the bottom of the bag the asparagus which was cooked lying flat yield better color and flavor.  Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device's owner's manual for proper food-handling and safety procedures.    Choose a container large enough to hold your food with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the container using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food.   Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator to 132 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.  Using a vegetable peeler peel the asparagus from the tip towards the base.   Line up the asparagus on a cutting board with the bottom of the Ziploc bag as your guide to how long your asparagus should be cut. Using a sharp knife carefully cut the asparagus so that the lengths are about the same size as the bag to enable the asparagus to snuggly fit into the bag.   Season the vegetables lightly with oil salt and pepper. Place the asparagus into the Ziploc bag so that the bottom of the asparagus is flat within the bag. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the vegetables.

But too often they get short shrift: a quick drizzle of butter a squirt of lemon and onto the table they go. We suggest you coddle them a little this year. Try tossing them in a hot skillet with shallots and pecans that get caramelized in buttery brown sugar and you'll see just how special green beans can be. Try seasoning them with an alder-smoked salt for an extra layer of flavor.  Heat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle.  Bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add green beans and cook uncovered until just tender 3 to 4 minutes. Using a large slotted spoon or tongs transfer beans to colander in ice water to stop cooking then drain well and dry on towels. Set aside.  In a large skillet toast pecans over a medium-high heat shaking the pan occasionally until nuts are beginning to brown and smell toasty about 5 minutes. Transfer to a dish a reserve. Add butter to skillet and cook over medium heat until foam subsides. Stir in sugar until almost dissolved. Add pecans stirring to heat through about 1 minute. Set aside.  In a large skillet heat olive oil over medium heat until oil begins to shimmer. Add shallots and cook until tender about 3 minutes.  Add reserved green beans and lemon zest and saute tossing them with tongs until heated through about 2 to 4 minutes. Add the pecan mixture and toss to mix.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   To serve: Pile the beans into a warmed serving dish and serve hot.

Greek Yogurt,Fagor,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Greek Yogurt,1 serving,nly need two ingredients to make yogurt at home: any type of milk and plain store-bought yogurt (with live active cultures) or starter yogurt.    Choosing the Milk - The following types of milk may be used:  Pasteurized milk of any fat content (full 2% 1% or skim milk)  Powdered milk  Long-life UHT sterilized milk  Soy Milk (Be sure to use UHT soy milk which contains one of the following ingredients: fructose honey or malt. These ingredients are necessary for fermentation and you will not succeed if none are available in the milk.)  Live Active Cultures-Unflavored Yogurt (All you need is a small amount of plain unflavored yogurt with live active cultures often called probiotics. The plain yogurt can either be purchased from a store or used from a previous batch of homemade yogurt.)  NOTE: For 5 cups of milk use  1/2 cup of plain yogurt or 1 packet starter culture. For 1 cup of milk use about one tablespoon of plain yogurt.    ,Yogurt Making Process:  Take the starter yogurt from the refrigerator so that it has time to come to room temperature while you heat the milk.   Place the desired amount of milk in the removable cooking pot. Leave the lid off and heat the milk to 180-185 degrees F by pressing the SLOW COOK LOW function. Use a thermometer to make sure that proper temperature has been reached.   Remove the removable cooking pot from heat and allow the milk to cool to lukewarm (100 degrees F-110 degrees F). To accelerate the cooling down process place the removable cooking pot in cold water. Do not let it cool below 90 degrees F.   Stir in the plain yogurt or starter culture packet and use a silicone whisk (metal will scratch cooking pot) to mix it with the milk until the consistency is smooth with no lumps remaining.  Place the lid on the Multi-cooker; align the handle with the condensation collector (open lock symbol) and turn it counterclockwise until the locking pin clicks into place. Turn the pressure regulator knob to STEAM when using the yogurt program. Press the YOGURT button. The preset cooking time is 8 hours. Depending on the flavor of yogurt you like best you can choose how long to cook the yogurt for by pressing the + or - button. With longer cooking time the yogurt will have a more tart flavor. With shorter time the yogurt will have a milder flavor.   Press the START/STOP button to begin the yogurt function. The unit will begin to count down in 1 minute increments once the correct temperature has been reached.   When the yogurt is ready remove the lid. There may be some yellowish liquid whey on top of the yogurt. This is normal whey contains nutrients and protein. Mix it back into the yogurt.   If you prefer regular yogurt cover and place in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours before serving or until yogurt cools down. If you prefer Greek yogurt continue reading.    Greek Yogurt: Place the strainer or a cheese cloth inside a container so the strainer doesn't touch the bottom of the container to allow for better drainage.   Pour the homemade yogurt into the strainer or cheese cloth and cover with the lid. Put it in the refrigerator to strain and chill for at least 2 hours. The longer the time the thicker the yogurt becomes.   Gently remove yogurt from strainer or cheese cloth by turning the strainer or cheese cloth upside down on a plate or container.   Put it back in the refrigerator to chill for another few hours before serving.

Sandwich Cookie Recipe,Chef'n,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Sandwich Cookie Recipe,1 serving, 1/2 cup butter at room temperature  2/3 cup sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt  1/2 teaspoon baking powder  1/8 teaspoon baking soda 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 4 egg yolks 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup cocoa powder 1 cup hot water Cooking spray  your favorite flavor of ice cream   ,The only thing better than ice cream is an ice cream sandwich and making them at home is a fun way to make them even more rewarding. The Chef'nreserved  set makes it easy to create the classic frozen treat of summer including silicone trays to bake the cookies. All you need to do then is add your favorite ice cream for homemade ice cream sandwiches that beat just about anything you'll find at the store.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  In a stand mixer combine butter sugar salt baking powder baking soda and vanilla. Mix until combined.  With mixer on low add eggs yolks one at a time. Once they've mixed in scrape down the bowl and turn the mixer back on low. Slowly add flour and cocoa powder.  Once incorporated carefully add hot water all at once and mix batter until smooth. You will need to scrape the bowl down and continue mixing for about 5 minutes to ensure a smooth texture. Consistency should be similar to cake batter no lumps is best.  Take both ice cream brownie molds and place them on a sheet pan lightly spray molds with cooking spray to ensure no sticking.  Portion 1 tablespoon of batter into each mold spreading with spade to ensure even coating in each mold. Do not exceed over mold shape.  Tap molds to remove excess air bubbles and wipe sides clean to prevent burning.  Bake for 10 minutes.  After removing molds from the oven you may gently push any overflowing batter back into each mold with a butter knife. This ensures the best shape for your sandwiches!  Place in refrigerator for 20 minutes or until completely chilled.  Once cookies are cooled place ice cream mold firmly into one of the cookie molds. With the included spade fill the ice cream mold with your favorite flavor ice cream making sure to smooth completely for your cookie tops!  Next carefully place the remaining cookie mold on top of the ice cream and snap firmly into place. Now place the entire mold into the freezer for at least 1 hour.  To remove sandwiches from the mold carefully remove the top cookie mold leaving the cookies in place.  Next flip the sandwich maker over a sheet pan and repeat with the bottom mold. Find the inscription on the ice cream mold that says “push out sandwiches here” and using both thumbs gently push at the ends of the sandwich onto the sheet pan. Do not press directly in the middle of the sandwich; this may result in it breaking. Use even pressure to ensure the best results!  Wrap each sandwich in wax paper and freeze in an airtight container for best quality.

Using a sharp slicing knife cut the lamb racks into individual chops. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and season on all sides with salt and pepper.  In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade place garlic parsley and rosemary and process using pulses until roughly chopped. With machine running drizzle in olive oil to form a coarse paste. Remove the garlic and herb paste from the food processor and rub all over the lamb chops. Cover chops with plastic wrap and marinate at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes.  Prepare a hot charcoal fire preheat a gas grill to medium-high or heat a large grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat grill grates or grill pan with a thin coating of oil. Place the lamb chops on the grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs turn the chops and cook to medium rare 3 to 4 minutes longer.

Quick Coq au Vin,Jacques Pepin Poulets & Legumes,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Quick Coq au Vin,4 servings,1 chicken (3 1/2- to 4-pounds) or 2 whole boneless chicken legs plus 2 whole boneless skinless breasts 12 small pearl onions 2 tablespoons olive oil  1/2 teaspoon sugar  1/2 cup water 4 large mushrooms (4 ounces) cleaned and quartered  1/3 cup finely chopped onion 3 garlic cloves crushed and finely chopped (2 teaspoons) 1 1/2 cups fruity dry robust red wine (such as Syrah or Grenache) 1 fresh thyme sprig or  1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley  3/4 teaspoon salt  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon potato starch dissolved in 2 tablespoons red wine  Croutons 4 slices firm white bread (4 ounces)  2 teaspoons canola oil   ,Traditionally coq au vin or chicken with red wine had to be cooked for a long time because the coq ("cock"-an older chicken) was tough. Now the dish can be made quickly with tender parts either cut from a young chicken or bought separately at the market. I divide the chicken into pieces remove the skin brown it and cook it in the red wine adding the breasts at the end so they don't get overdone. I glaze the onions separately in a little olive oil and sugar stirring the mushrooms in near the end. Finally I combine everything and serve it with large heart-shaped croutons.  If using a whole chicken cut off the wings and cut them at the joints into 3 pieces each. Cut the chicken into 4 pieces: 2 breasts and 2 legs. Skin and bone the breasts. Set the breasts aside with the 4 meatier wing pieces. (Freeze the bones and wing tips for stock if desired.)  To bone the chicken legs first pull off the skin and cut the tips off the drumsticks. Then cut down each side of the thighbone and slide your knife under the bone to separate the meat from it. Holding the thighbone cut all around the joint at the knee to loosen the meat. Scrape down the drumstick bone and pull out the bones. Set the legs aside with the breasts and wing pieces.  Put the pearl onions 1 tablespoon of the oil the sugar and the water in a large saucepan bring to a boil over high heat and boil until the water has evaporated and the onions start frying. Continue to cook stirring or shaking the pan occasionally until the onions are glazed on all sides. Add the mushrooms and saute for 1 minute. Set aside covered.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet. When it is hot add the chicken wing pieces if you have them and saute for 2 to 3 minutes until lightly browned on all sides. Add the legs and brown for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Add the breasts and brown for 2 minutes on each side. Remove all the chicken pieces to a plate.  Add the chopped onion to the drippings in the skillet and saute for 1 minute. Add the garlic and cook for about 10 seconds. Add the wine thyme bay leaves salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Return the legs and the wings to the pan cover and boil very gently for 5 minutes. Add the chicken breasts and boil gently for another 6 minutes.  Add the dissolved potato starch to the chicken and stir until the pan juices are thickened. Add the pearl onions and mushrooms with their juices. Keep warm.  Croutons: Meanwhile trim the crusts from the bread and cut each slice diagonally in half to form 2 triangles. Trim each triangle into a heart-shaped crouton.   Spread the oil on a cookie sheet and press the croutons into the oil so they are moistened on both sides. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until nicely browned.  At serving time dip the top of each crouton into the sauce to moisten it and then into the chopped parsley. Cut the chicken breast pieces and legs in half serve 1 breast piece 1 drumstick or thigh and if you have them 1 piece of wing per person with 2 croutons along with some of the sauce and vegetables. Sprinkle the remaining chopped parsley over the chicken.   
Garlic Lemon Rosemary Roasted Chicken,Rebecca White A Pleasant Little Kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Garlic Lemon Rosemary Roasted Chicken,1 serving,3- to 5-pound whole chicken (pasture-roaming chicken preferred)  2 tablespoons kosher salt (or less depending on the size of the chicken selected)  Freshly cracked black pepper (to your taste)  3 to 4 rosemary sprigs 2 heads of garlic halved 3 lemons halved 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil   ,A whole chicken roasted with lemons garlic and rosemary will fill your home with warm and delicious flavors as it is cooked. Simple ingredients basic roasting techniques and an instant read thermometer will make the perfect roasted chicken every time.  Thirty minutes to 1 hour before roasting remove the chicken from the fridge and begin to bring it to room temperature. Placing a cold chicken into a hot oven will increase the cooking time as well as affect the quality of the end product.  Meanwhile set the oven to 425 degrees F.  In a small bowl combine the salt and pepper. Mix well.  Remove the insides of the chicken pat the chicken dry and truss the legs. Place in a cast-iron skillet Dutch oven or small roasting pan.  Pour about  1/2 the salt and pepper combination inside the chicken cavity. Then place the rosemary 2 garlic halves and 2 lemon halves inside the chicken. Don't worry if all the pieces do not fit inside the chicken. Each chicken is different as is the garlic cloves and lemons. At least get the rosemary 1 garlic half and 1 lemon half inside the bird.  Scatter the remaining garlic and lemon around the chicken.  Pour the oil over the chicken and massage it into the skin. Evenly sprinkle the salt and pepper mixture over the chicken. There may be some left over and that is OK. Again each chicken is sized differently and may not require as much salt and pepper.  Cook the chicken for 50 to 60 minutes. Place the thermometer between the chicken leg and breast. If the internal temperature has reached 163-165 degrees F the chicken is done. If not place the chicken back in the oven and cook for an additional 5 to 15 minutes depending on its temperature.  When the chicken is done remove from the oven cover the chicken tightly with foil and let rest for 10 minutes.  Break the chicken down and then serve with the pan juices. If you plan on using for later break the chicken down place in a glass container and cover with the pan juices. The chicken will keep for about 5 days.

Apple Cider Marinated Pork with Sage-Sweet Potatoes,Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Apple Cider Marinated Pork with Sage-Sweet Potatoes,4 servings, style="font-size:12pt">1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin trimmed 1-1/2 cups sparkling apple cider 4 tablespoons olive oil divided 1 large sweet potato peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes 1 medium yellow onion minced 1 medium garlic clove minced 1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth low-sodium 2 tablespoons minced sage leaves 2 tablespoon lemon juice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  ,We have found using sparkling cider to be the most effective and quickest option for marinating the pork. The acidic properties of the cider give a more tender and flavorful pork.   Using a very sharp knife cut the tenderloin into four equal slices. Using the heel of your hand flatten each slice lightly to approximately 1-1/2-inches.  Arrange the pork medallions in a shallow baking dish and pour apple cider over the meat ensuring all pieces of meat are covered in liquid. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate at room temperature for 25 to 30 minutes.  To cook sweet potato mixture: In a large nonstick skillet over a medium heat add 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the sweet potato and cook stirring occasionally until just starting to soften about 10 minutes. Add the onions and cook stirring occasionally until tender about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant about 1 minute. Add the apple cider used to marinate the pork broth and sage and cook until the sweet potatoes are tender and the sauce is reduced about 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside and keep warm.  To cook the pork medallions: Pat-dry the pork with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Place a large non-stick skillet on the stove over a medium-high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. When the oil is shimmering add the pork medallions and cook turning once until the meat registers 145&ordm;F on an instant read thermometer about 5 minutes. Using tongs transfer to a plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes.  To serve: Reheat the sweet potato mixture and place in the middle of warmed plates. Divide the cooked pork medallions on top of the mixture and serve immediately.

A Perfect Loaf of Bread,Andris Lagsdin The Baking Steel,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/A Perfect Loaf of Bread,4 loaves,500 Grams All-purpose flour (I used bread flour)  375 Grams water 80 degrees F  1/2 teaspoon of active dry yeast 10 grams of sea salt   ,This recipe is very similar to Jim Lahey's no knead pizza dough.  There are a few differences in the technique. A little more time and patience is required you can decide if it's worth the extra effort.   First whisk the flour and yeast next incorporate the water.  Mix and then make a well in the center.  Pour in the salt and let rest for 20 minutes uncovered.  Next we're going to fold each corner into the center one at a time. So fold turn the bowl and fold again.  Continue this process for about 1 minute.  Then let the dough rest for 20 minutes.  Continue this process 3 times but the 3rd time you'll notice a little bounce or spring in the dough. This is ideal.  Now you're going to let this dough rest covered for 7 hours and the dough will double in size. It's likely best to divide this work into two days. Leaving the dough in the fridge overnight is a good strategy.  Remove the dough and check out the beautiful air bubbles allow dough to sit a room temp for a couple of hours. It's going to rise a bit again...  Preheat your Baking Steel at 450 degrees F for about 45 minutes and place a sheet tray or pan on the bottom rack at the same time we're going to create some steam.  Flour a work surface with a combination of flour and semolina. Mix both well on top of parchment paper.  Remove the dough and place carefully on parchment.  You're going to form into a rectangle about 10- x 16-inch don't stress over the size.  Just not too thin....  Divide the dough with a bench scraper into 4 long strips and let rest for 20 minutes.  Now we have to launch the back of a sheet tray is a good tool. Slide the parchment on the back side of a sheet tray.  Carefully this dough is soft.  I did all four at the same time an easier strategy may be to start with two and then repeat.  Immediately after the launch place  1/2 cup of water into your steam pan.  Close the oven and bake for 20 minutes until golden brown. Boom! You're done...

Classic Fudgy Brownies,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Classic Fudgy Brownies,16 (2-inch) brownies, 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces 4 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate finely chopped 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate finely chopped 1 cup sugar 2 large eggs at room temperature 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract  1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour Pinch of salt  1/2 cup chocolate chips or chunks (optional)  1/2 cup chopped nuts of your choice toasted and cooled (optional)   ,Rich dark fudgy and slightly chewy these homemade brownies are always a hit so much better than anything you can buy. Serve cold with a glass of milk or warm from the oven with a scoop of ice cream. Like a simple black dress they can be accessorized to match any occasion. For a casual snack serve them right out of the pan. For something a bit dressier dust the brownies with a layer of powdered sugar. Or drizzle melted dark chocolate (or dark milk and/or white chocolate) wildly over the top.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center. Line an 8-inch square cake pan with foil or parchment paper across the bottom and up two of the sides then lightly coat with an oil spray.  Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in the bottom of a double boiler. Place the butter semisweet chocolate and unsweetened chocolate in the top of the double boiler (off the heat). Turn off the heat then set the butter and chocolate over the steaming water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted and smooth.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar. Whisk in the eggs one at a time stirring well to incorporate each before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla. Whisk in the flour and salt. Continue to stir until the batter changes from dull and broken-looking to smooth and shiny about 1 minute. Whisk in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts if using.  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until a skewer inserted into the center of the brownies comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it (do not overbake). Transfer to a rack and cool completely.  Run a thin knife or flexible spatula around the edges of the pan to loosen the brownies. Grasp the foil or parchment paper extending up the sides and pull gently upward. Set the brownies on a cutting surface and cut into 16 equal pieces. Since these are fudgy keep a hot wrung-out wet towel nearby so you can wipe the knife clean between slices. You could also serve the brownies right out of the pan if you like pressing a piece of plastic wrap against any cut surfaces and across the top to keep them fresh. Tightly wrap the remaining brownies in plastic or place in an airtight container. They will keep well at room temperature for 2 to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Tomato & Eggplant Rice with Toasted Almonds,All-Clad & Chef Hugh Acheson,home/recipes/side-dishes/pasta-grains-legumes/Tomato & Eggplant Rice with Toasted Almonds,4 servings,2 cups jasmine rice (soaked for 8 hours in 3 cups water 1 teaspoon sea salt 2 tablespoons lemon juice-**use the measuring cup provided with All Clad Grain Cooker)  2 tablespoons olive oil  1/2 cup sweet onion diced 2 tablespoons fresh ginger peeled and minced 1 1/2  teaspoons fresh serrano small diced 2 teaspoons ground turmeric 1 teaspoon garam marsala 3 cardamom pods 1 1/2 cups Roma tomatoes chopped (about 2 Roma tomatoes)  1 1/2 cups eggplant cubed 2 teaspoons salt plus a little extra to taste 1 3/4 cups chicken stock (**use measuring cup provided with the All Clad Grain Cooker)   3/4 cup slivered almonds 1 cup Greek yogurt  1/2 cup green onion thinly sliced   , This is a great "one pot" dish recipe inspired by a south Indian classic-Tomato rice.   Preparing this recipe in the All-Clad Rice & Grain Cooker is an excellent choice and will free up valuable stove top space. This recipe uses some wonderfully aromatic ingredients and has just a hint of spiciness. This dish works well as a side or could be great as a meal on its own if you're into that sort of thing. (I am.)  First using a fine mesh strainer strain the soaked rice and give it a quick rinse under cold water. Set aside.   Set the All-Clad Rice & Grain Cooker to the "SAUTÉ" setting and press start. Add olive oil and let heat for 1 minute.   Once the oil begins to shimmer add the onion ginger serrano and cook for 1 minute. Add turmeric garam marsala and cardamom pods and cook for another 2 minutes.   Next add the tomatoes and eggplant. Season with salt and cook for 3 minutes more. (Tip: Don't cook these portions any longer than needed as the onions and eggplant will continue to cook with the rice once it's added.)   Now add strained and rinsed rice to the cooker and stir well with the other ingredients. Set the cooker to the WHITE RICE setting and press start. Add chicken stock and cover with the lid.   The grain cooker will give you a little *beep* of reassurance once it starts counting down at the 8 minute mark so don't open that lid to check how things are going. Trust that little cooker!   While the rice is cooking place a medium saute pan over medium high heat. Add the slivered almonds and toast for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown. Keep a close watch and stir often. Those slivered almonds are testy and will burn quickly if left unattended.   Once rice timer goes off remove the lid and use the plastic spoon/spatula stir the rice to make sure everything is evenly mixed. Season with salt to your liking.   To serve separate the rice into four bowls. Garnish each bowl of rice with  3/4 cup of Greek yogurt with a sprinkling of toasted almonds and sliced green onions.    
Paella Mixta (with Shellfish),Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Paella Mixta (with Shellfish),6 to 8 servings,Sofrito:  3 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup finely diced yellow onion   1/2 cup finely diced red bell pepper  1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 cup crushed tomatoes or fresh tomato grated on a box grater     1/2 teaspoon pimenton  1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1 bay leaf    Paella:  3  1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth  2 tablespoons olive oil  1 pound medium shrimp peeled deveined and tails removed  1 generous pinch saffron   2 teaspoons pimenton  1 teaspoon turmeric 4 ounces Spanish-style chorizo diced into 1/4-inch pieces    1  1/2 cups Spanish paella rice  2 teaspoons sea salt  1/3 cup fresh shelled or frozen peas thawed  1/2 pound small clams scrubbed   1/2 pound mussels scrubbed and bearded  1 lemon cut into wedges   ,To prepare the sofrito: Heat the oil in a paella pan or medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions stirring frequently until tender and lightly caramelized 5 to 8 minutes. Add red pepper and garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes pimenton salt and bay. Reduce heat to medium and stir frequently until the sauce is thick and turns a deep brick red color about 10 minutes.   Bring chicken broth to a simmer in a large saucepan; reduce heat to low and cover to keep broth hot.   To prepare the paella: Push the sofrito to the side of the pan and add oil. When oil is shimmering add shrimp to the pan and sear until bright pink on both sides about 60 seconds. Transfer shrimp to a plate using a slotted spoon and set aside. Next add the spices to the hot pan and toast for 30 seconds. Add the chorizo and stir to combine with sofrito and spices. Ladle 3 cups hot broth into pan and stir in rice and salt shaking the pan to evenly distribute the rice grains. Increase the heat to medium-high and boil for 5 to 7 minutes or until the rice just starts to break the surface of the broth. Reduce heat to medium-low cover and simmer gently undisturbed for 5 minutes. During the process if the rice looks dry and undercooked drizzle in additional chicken broth. Remove the lid and tuck the shellfish and partially cooked shrimp into the paella cover and continue to cook for 5 minutes or until the rice is tender and the shellfish is cooked through. Remove and discard any shellfish that do not open.      Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high; cook for about 2 minutes until the bottom layer of rice starts to crackle and caramelize creating the socarrat. At this point you will need to closely monitor the paella and frequently move your pan around on the burner to evenly distribute the heat. With a spoon gently scrape a small portion of rice from the bottom peeking to make sure the rice is sticking and caramelizing but not burning (the rice should smell toasty not burnt). If the rice is browned and caramelized on the bottom of the pan and the rice grains are al dente (chewy but slightly resistant texture) remove from heat; sprinkle peas over the rice and cover letting the paella rest for 10 minutes.   To serve: Garnish with lemon wedges and serve family-style straight from the pan.

Ultimate Pumpkin Pie with Rum Whipped Cream,Ina Garten Barefoot Contessa Foolproof,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Ultimate Pumpkin Pie with Rum Whipped Cream,8 to 10 servings,Filling: 1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree (not pie filling)   1/2 cup light brown sugar lightly packed  3/4 cup granulated sugar  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon ground ginger  3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt 2 teaspoons grated orange zest 3 extra-large eggs lightly beaten 1 cup heavy cream  1/2 cup whole milk 2 tablespoons dark rum such as Mount Gay Dried beans for blind baking  Rum Whipped Cream: 1 cup cold heavy cream 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon mascarpone or creme fraiche 1 tablespoon good dark rum such as Mount Gay 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  Perfect Pie Crust: yields 2 (9- to 11-inch crusts) 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) very cold unsalted butter 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon Kosher salt  1/3 cup very cold vegetable shortening such as Crisco  1/2 cup ice water   ,Pumpkin pie can be boring and dense so I set out to make a better pumpkin pie. Pumpkin has a distinct squash flavor that you want to enhance without overpowering it. I've filled the prebaked crust with a lightly spiced pumpkin mixture that tastes more like a mousse than a dense custard. Dark rum and grated orange zest are my secret ingredients. - Ina Garten  Prepare the pie crust: Cut the butter in  1/2-inch dice and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. Place the flour sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out onto a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle at least 1 inch larger than the pie pan rolling from the center to the edge turning and flouring the dough so it doesn't stick to the board. (You should see bits of butter in the dough.) Fold the dough in half ease it into the pie pan without stretching at all and unfold to fit the pan. With a small sharp paring knife cut the dough 1 inch larger around than the pan. Fold the edge under and crimp the edge with either your fingers or the tines of a fork.  NOTE: Store the shortening in the refrigerator so it's always cold. You can store the prepared pie crust in the fridge for up to a day.  Make the pie: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Line an 11-inch pie pan with the unbaked pie crust and place it on a sheet pan. Line the crust with parchment paper. Fill the paper  3/4 full with the beans and bake the crust for 15 minutes until the edges start to brown. Remove the beans and paper (save the beans for another time) prick the crust all over with the tines of a fork and bake for another 5 minutes.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.  Meanwhile in a large bowl whisk together the pumpkin brown sugar granulated sugar cinnamon ginger nutmeg salt orange zest eggs cream milk and rum. Pour the filling into the baked pie shell.  Bake for 55 to 65 minutes until the filling is just set in the middle and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Set aside to cool completely. Serve with the rum whipped cream.  Rum Whipped Cream: Place the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sugar mascarpone rum and vanilla. Beat on medium-high until it forms soft peaks. Serve with the pumpkin pie.  NOTE: If you overwhip the cream and it looks curdled just add a little more cream and whip it until it forms soft peaks.   
Sweet Potato Pie with Pecan Streusel,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Sweet Potato Pie with Pecan Streusel,1 (9-inch) pie,All purpose flour for dusting work surface 1 recipe Perfect Pie Crust   Filling: 1 pound sweet potatoes preferably Jewel 4 tablespoons unsalted butter melted  3/4 cup granulated sugar  3/4 cup tightly packed light brown sugar 2 large eggs 1 large egg yolk  3/4 cup whole milk 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  Pecan Streusel: 1 stick unsalted butter room temperature  3/4 cup packed light brown sugar  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup all-purpose flour  3/4 cup chopped pecans   ,If you think sweet potato pie and pumpkin pie are interchangeable then think again! The smooth velvety sweet potato layer is topped with a nutty streusel and we bet this pie will be a hit at any Thanksgiving buffet table.  Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F and position a rack in the center.   To prepare pie: Lightly flour a work surface and draw a 12-inch circle in the flour. This guide will be the perfect size for a standard 9-inch pie dish. Place 1 recipe of pie crust in the center of the circle and dust a little flour on top. Using the circle as a guide roll out the dough into a 12-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over a 9-inch pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Trim the dough so that it overhangs by 1 inch. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.   To prepare sweet potatoes: While the pie dough is chilling prepare the sweet potatoes. Use a fork to poke the sweet potatoes all over and arrange them on a large foil-lined baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until tender about 1 hour.  To blind bake the pie dough: Line base with foil and fill with pie weights. Place pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet and blind bake pastry crust for 15 minutes. Remove pie weights and foil and prick base with a fork. Bake 15 to 17 minutes longer. Remove pan from oven and place on a wire rack to cool. The pie shell is now ready to be filled.  To prepare filling: Peel the cooked potatoes and place the flesh into a food processor fitted with a metal blade and process until smooth. Add the melted butter granulated and brown sugars the eggs egg yolk milk vanilla bean paste cinnamon nutmeg and salt to the food processor and process until smooth.  To prepare streusel topping: In a bowl use a wooden spoon to thoroughly combine the butter brown sugar salt flour and pecans.   To assemble pie: Pour the filling into the pie crust and scatter the streusel over the top. Transfer to the oven to bake until the filling is set but slightly wobbly about 45 to 50 minutes. Remove the pie from oven and place onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool for 2 hours prior to serving. The pie center will solidify as the pie cools.    
Graham Cracker Crumb Pie Crust,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Graham Cracker Crumb Pie Crust,enough dough for 9 turnovers 8 dumplings or 1 (9-or 10-inch) pie shell,1 1/2 cups (7 ounces) finely ground graham cracker cookie crumbs 1 tablespoon ( 1/2 ounce) sugar  3/4 stick (3 ounces) unsalted butter melted   ,This easy crust is kid-friendly to make and pairs well with any chilled pudding-style filling or cheesecake. A scale will give you the most precise measurement. If you don't own one be sure to finely grind or crush your cookies before you measure them. A food processor makes quick work of this or you can place the cookies in a resealable plastic bag and powder them with a rolling pin. Lots of cookies work well here; just make sure they are dry and crispy. Gingersnaps chocolate wafer cookies and shortbread are fine. Big chewy cookies with chocolate chips or dried fruit will not work and should be avoided.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center. Put the cookie crumbs and the sugar in the medium bowl and stir well with a spatula to blend. Add the melted butter and stir until all the crumbs are evenly moistened. Transfer the buttered crumbs to the pie pan. Use the heel of your hand a tart tamper or the bottom of a drinking glass to press the crumbs from the center outward into an even layer across the bottom of the pan. Use your thumbs to press the crumbs up the side of the pan and level them at the rim.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until lightly colored and fragrant. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.  Storing: Store at room temperature covered in plastic wrap.   
Peach Crostata,Jim Dodge,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Peach Crostata,1 serving,Dough 1 1/2 cups organic unbleached all-purpose flour 5 oz. cold European or low-moisture unsalted butter 3 tablespoons cold water 1 large egg yolk 1 large egg white beaten until smooth  Filling 5 ripe medium-size peaches (about 2 pounds) 6 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons tapioca flour  ,For the dough:  Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper so it lies flat on the pan. Set aside until needed. Adjust oven rack to the lower-third level and preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Add the flour to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Remove the cold butter from the refrigerator and cut into about  3/4"-wide slices. Add the cold butter and salt on top of the flour place cover securely on top and pulse twice to coat the butter chunks with flour.  Process continuously until a coarse meal has formed. The mixture should feel cool and slightly grainy like cornmeal. If there are still large pieces of isolated butter then you need to process a little bit more but be careful not to overmix which would be beyond the coarse-meal stage.  Once the meal is coarse remove the cover. In a small bowl beat the yolk with the 3 tablespoons cold water until smooth. Pour over the top of the coarse meal halfway between the side of the bowl and the center blade. Place the cover on top and continue processing only until a ball forms and rolls around in the bowl twice. Stop the processor.   Lightly dust the top of a smooth counter with extra all-purpose flour. Turn the dough out onto center of the dusted counter. Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour from sifter. Knead the dough gently and quickly just until smooth. Dust lightly with additional flour only as needed to prevent the dough from sticking to the table and your hands.  Form dough into a round disc with smooth edges about 6 inches in diameter. Place the disc of dough on the center of the flour-dusted counter. Keep the counter and top of dough lightly dusted with flour while rolling. Occasionally glide your hand under the dough and rotate it in a circle to ensure it is not sticking to the counter. If the dough begins to stick to the counter or rolling pin that's when you want to dust with more flour. Roll the dough into a 12" circle. Using a dry soft 3-"-wide bristle pastry brush brush off any extra flour from the dough.  Roll the dough around the rolling pin and unroll on parchment-lined cookie sheet.   In a small bowl beat the egg white until smooth. Dip a small pastry brush into the egg white. Paint a thin layer of beaten egg white over the top of the rolled dough. Save the extra beaten egg white for use later.  For the filling:  Wash the peaches in cold water and towel dry. Cut into  1/2"-thick slices. Place slices in a large bowl. In a small bowl  combine the sugar and tapioca stir together until evenly blended. Sprinkle tapioca and sugar mixture over the peaches. Using a rubber spatula or large kitchen spoon fold only until the fruit is covered.   Add the peaches to the center of the dough and evenly spread leaving about a 2 1/2" border. Gently press the peaches to close any large gaps between the slices.   Glide your hand under the edge of the dough about 2 1/2" in and fold halfway toward the center of the filling. Continue this motion making a pleat as you fold each piece of the edge until you have finished and created an outer edge with an open center. Once done lightly paint the top ring of folded dough with egg white. Place in the preheated oven on the lower third rack.  After 30 minutes remove from the oven. Using the back of a large oval soup spoon gently press peaches down to the level of the juices. This will give a simple glaze to the top of the peaches. Return to the oven and reduce heat to 400 degrees F. Continue baking another15-20 minutes until the fruit is tender and the crust is golden brown. Place the pan on a wire rack for even cooling.

Sweet Crust  Start out by making the crust at least 2-4 hours ahead of time however it is best to allow the dough to chill in the fridge overnight prior to baking.  In a medium size bowl mix the flour and sugar. Using a pastry cutter or fork cut in the butter until pea sized lumps form.  Next add in the egg yolks. Using a pastry cutter or fork blend into the flour mixture.  Add in a tablespoon of water and start to knead the dough together. Add a tablespoon of water at a time until the dough just comes together. Dough should be smooth and not sticky.  Separate the dough in half then flatten into discs. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap place one disc into the freezer for a later use and the other in the fridge to chill overnight for the tart.    Blood Orange Curd   When ready to bake tart remove your dough from the fridge and place on the counter. Allow the dough to come to room temperature for about 15 minutes.  Remove the plastic wrap and roll out the dough so it fits into the 9 inch tart pan. Be sure to lift the dough occasionally to keep it from sticking.  Place the dough into the tart pan and press firmly against the sides and bottom without stretching the dough.  Trim off any excess dough. Pop the tart pan in the fridge for at least 30 minutes prior to baking.  Once ready to bake preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Prick the dough all over with a fork. Lightly cover the tart pan with aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes remove the aluminum foil and continue to bake the dough for an additional 5 minutes. Once the crust is light golden brown remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before adding the filling.  While the crust is cooling make the Blood Orange Curd.  In a heavy bottomed pot stir together the egg yolks and sugar whisking for one minute until pale in color. Add in the juice from the blood oranges cornstarch and butter then continue to whisk until the curd thickens and reaches 170 degrees.  Strain the curd in a fine mesh strainer over a bowl.  Pour the strained curd into the crust being sure to spread evenly.  Cool the tart for at least 2 hours prior to serving. Enjoy!

Vanilla Shortcrust Dough,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/dough/Vanilla Shortcrust Dough,1 (9- or 9 1/2-inch) tart shell,1 3/4 cups (6 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar  3/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces 2 large egg yolks 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 to 3 teaspoons water   ,To mix the dough using a food processor: Place the flour sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 5 times to blend. Add the cold butter pieces and pulse 6 to 8 times just until the butter is the size of large peas. In the small bowl whisk together the egg yolks vanilla and 1 teaspoon water. Add to the butter mixture then process just until the dough begins to form small clumps 5 to 10 seconds. Do not let the dough form a ball. Test the dough by squeezing a handful of clumps-when you open your hand they should hold together. If they are crumbly and fall apart sprinkle 1 teaspoon water over the dough and pulse several times then test again. Repeat if necessary.  To mix the dough by hand:  Place the flour sugar and salt in the medium bowl and blend well with the whisk. Add the cold butter pieces and toss until they are lightly coated with the flour. Use the pastry blender or your fingertips to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles bread crumbs or crushed crackers. If at any time during this process the butter softens and becomes warm place the bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes before continuing. In the small bowl whisk together the egg yolks vanilla and 1 teaspoon water. Add to the dry ingredients and toss between your fingertips or with a fork 20 to 30 times to evenly distribute the moisture. The dough will still look very crumbly but if the mixture is squeezed in your hand it should hold together. If not sprinkle another teaspoon of water over the top and toss to blend. Repeat if necessary.  Finish the dough:  Turn the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and knead gently 2 or 3 times just to finish bringing it together. Shape it into a disk about 6 inches in diameter. If the dough is still cool to the touch continue on to the next step. If the dough is soft and sticky wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before continuing.  To make the tart shell:  Make sure the dough is cool but malleable. If it has been refrigerated or frozen and is quite hard let it sit on the counter for 10 to 12 minutes before rolling. Place the dough disk between two 14-inch pieces of waxed paper parchment paper or plastic wrap. Roll it into an 11-inch round rotating it (and the paper) clockwise slightly after each roll to create an even round. Remember to roll from the center outward and to lift the rolling pin at the edge to avoid smashing the edge into the paper which will make removing the paper difficult.  As you roll the paper or plastic wrap will get wrinkled into the dough. When this happens peel it off smooth out the wrinkles and lay it back on the dough. Flip the dough over and repeat if necessary with the top piece. Continue to roll flipping and smoothing wrinkles as necessary until the dough is 11 inches across and between  1/8 and  3/4 inch thick. If the dough is soft and sticky transfer it to a baking sheet and chill it for 30 minutes. Peel off the top piece of paper or plastic. Leave the bottom piece attached. Lift the dough by the exposed paper or plastic and flip it over and center it over the tart pan as best you can.  Peel off the paper or plastic. Ease the dough across the bottom of the pan and up the sides pressing it into the corners of the pan with your fingertips. Once the dough is even in the pan fold the excess dough at the edge inward to create a double layer of dough along the wall. Press firmly with your thumbs to fuse the two layers of dough then roll your thumb over the rim of the pan to remove any excess dough there. Refrigerate for 1 hour or freeze for 30 minutes before baking.

Brioche Muffins,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/breakfast/doughnuts-muffins-more/Brioche Muffins,12 muffins,2- 3/4 cups All-purpose Flour divided 1- 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast  3/4 cup cool water 4 large eggs 2 tablespoons granulated sugar  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter softened    Egg wash 1 large egg 1 tablespoon water  ,Place 1- 1/2 cups of the flour the yeast water and eggs into the bowl of a mixer or the bucket of your bread machine. Beat at medium speed (or knead in the bread machine) until smooth. Cover the mixture and let it sit for 45 minutes.   After 45 minutes the sponge will have developed some bubbles but will not have raised much because the mixture is thin. The yeast is getting a jump start.  Add the remaining 1- 3/4 cups flour the sugar and salt.   Beat for 8 to 10 minutes (switch to a dough hook if you're using a mixer) or knead in the bread machine until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and becomes shiny and elastic.   With the mixer or bread machine running add the soft butter 2 tablespoons at a time letting the butter become absorbed before adding the next chunk. Repeat until all of the butter is added. Cover the dough and let it rise for 1 hour. It'll be very soft at this point and should have grown by about a third. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently fold it over several times (use a bench knife to scrape up any bits that stick to the table). Place the dough into a greased bowl cover the bowl and refrigerate it for a minimum of 4 hours and up to about 16 hours. The dough will firm up considerably.  To make individual brioche: Divide the dough into 12 pieces. Take a marble sized piece of dough from each of the 12 pieces and set it aside. Roll each larger bit of dough into a ball; place them in muffin tins. Roll the small pieces into balls. Set them aside and let them rise with the small brioche for 45 minutes to 1 hour.     To bake:  When the dough has risen and is puffy-looking preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease your finger and poke a "belly button" into the center of each individual brioche. Gently place the small marble of dough's into these dents then brush the tops with egg wash. Bake the brioche for 25 to 30 minutes until the centers test 190 degrees F when measured with an instant-read thermometer. Remove the brioche from the oven and cool on a rack before serving.

Frozen pearl onions will work in this recipe; however fresh will have better texture and flavor. Peeling pearl onions is easier after a short blanch.  Instant Pot Directions:  Set Instant Pot to Saute and add oil. When oil is shimmering add bacon and saute bacon pieces until lightly browned about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to a medium bowl and reserve bacon fat in the pan.    Dry the beef thoroughly with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan add the beef to the Instant Pot and sear turning as needed until browned on all sides. Transfer seared beef to bowl with bacon. Reduce heat setting to low and add the carrot and onion to the pan; saute until lightly browned about 8 minutes.   Return the beef and vegetables; season lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over and toss to lightly coat. Slowly stir in wine and add enough broth to just cover the meat. Stir in tomato paste garlic thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Lock the lid and select High Pressure setting the timer for 40 minutes.   While the beef is cooking blanch the pearl onions in rapidly boiling salted water until tender about 4 minutes.

When butter is melted and foaming subsides add pearl onions and mushrooms and stir to coat vegetables with the melted butter. Drizzle with sherry vinegar and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook stirring often until the vegetables are tender and have developed caramelization about 8 minutes.   When the timer on Instant Pot goes off release the pressure and check the meat. If meat is not tender cook for additional 5 minutes or so. Remove the meat and vegetables to a bowl discard thyme and bay leaves. Select Saute setting on Instant Pot and reduce the braising liquid skimming off the fat. Add the sauteed onions and mushrooms. Continue simmering until the liquid reduces into a sauce and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Return beef and vegetables and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   To serve: Just before serving stir in parsley taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and ladle into shallow soup bowls.  Stovetop Directions:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Position 1 rack in the middle of the oven and make sure there is enough clearance for the Dutch oven with the lid on the top rack.    To a large Dutch oven set over medium heat add oil. When oil is shimmering add bacon and saute bacon pieces until lightly browned about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to a medium bowl and reserve bacon fat in the pan.    Dry the beef thoroughly with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Return Dutch oven to medium-high heat.

Mojo Pork Tacos,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Mojo Pork Tacos,4 servings,1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1 teaspoon dried oregano Kosher salt and ground black pepper 2 pounds boneless pork butt trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks 1 tablespoon grapeseed or other neutral oil 1 large yellow onion finely chopped 8 medium garlic cloves minced 2 chipotle chilies in adobo minced plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce 1 teaspoon grated orange zest plus 1 cup orange juice 1 teaspoon grated lime zest plus 3 tablespoons lime juice  1 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro 8 to 12 corn tortillas warmed   , Cuban mojo is a tangy pungent garlic-citrus mixture that's often used as a marinade for pork as well as a sauce. We use it to balance the richness of tender shredded pork in these flavorful tacos. A pressure cooker helps us keep the cooking time weeknight-appropriate. Sour Seville oranges are used in authentic mojo; to mimic their flavor we combined regular orange juice and lime juice as well as their zests for fragrance. Though mojo is not typically smoky or spicy we liked the complexity that smoked paprika and chipotle chili added. For more heat use hot smoked paprika or an additional chipotle chili. Start timing the pork once it has come to high pressure. If you prefer instead of making tacos serve the pork over rice with sliced oranges and avocado.  Don't be shy when trimming the fat from the pork or the tacos will be too greasy.  In a medium bowl combine the cumin paprika oregano 1 teaspoon salt and  1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the pork and stir to coat. Set aside.   In a 5 1/2-liter or larger pressure cooker over medium heat the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook stirring occasionally until softened about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Stir in the chipotles and adobo sauce. Stir in the pork then the orange juice. Lock the lid in place and bring to high pressure. Adjust heat to low to stabilize pressure. Cook for 25 minutes.  Off heat allow the pressure to reduce naturally for 20 minutes then quick release the remaining pressure. Carefully open the lid and tilt it away from you to release the residual steam. Using a slotted spoon transfer the meat to a large bowl and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Use 2 forks to shred the meat into bite-sized pieces.  Meanwhile return the pressure cooker uncovered to medium-high and vigorously simmer the liquid stirring occasionally until reduced to 1 cup 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the lime juice and cilantro.

Pizza Bianco with Four Cheeses,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/pizza/Pizza Bianco with Four Cheeses,8 (5-inch) pizzas,1 recipe Neapolitan Pizza Dough (ingredients below)  Corn meal as needed  Extra-virgin olive oil as needed for brushing the dough 2 tablespoons kosher salt 8 cloves of garlic minced 2 tablespoons of finely chopped rosemary 8 ounces Fontina cheese 8 ounces Pecorino cheese 8 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese  8 ounces Asiago cheese  Neapolitan Pizza Dough Yields 4 (10-inch) pizzas or 8 individual (5-inch) pizzas.   2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour plus more as needed and for work surface  2 teaspoons granulated sugar  1 teaspoon kosher salt   1 envelope (2- 3/4 teaspoons) instant yeast 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil plus more for oiling the bowl   ,Traditionally a pizza bianco is a simple flat bread topped with olive oil salt and rosemary. In this version we are adding cheese and garlic to create the ultimate bianco quattro formaggi!   Authentic Neapolitan pizza dough is a simple thin-crust pizza dough that originated in Naples in the 1800s. Originally pizzas in Naples were made with a simple tomato sauce and vegetables. Cheese did not become a usual topping until the 1880s.  To make the dough: Place flour sugar salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds to combine. With mixer running on low speed add water and olive oil and mix for 1 minute to combine. Increase speed to medium and process until dough forms a slightly sticky ball about 1 to 2 minutes. If ball does not form add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time and continue mixing until ball forms. Coat a large mixing bowl with a thin film of olive oil. Transfer dough ball to prepared mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest until doubled in volume about 1- 1/2 to 2 hours.   Once dough is ready press it gently to remove air bubbles and turn out on a lightly floured work surface. Using a bench scraper divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a tight ball cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for 15 minutes before baking.  To make the pizza: Place a pizza stone in the lower third of your oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Allow the pizza stone to preheat for at least 30 minutes.   Once your stone is preheated you can start rolling out your dough. Dust work surface with flour. Flatten one dough ball to a thickness of  1/2 inch and roll to a diameter of about 5 inches keeping the remaining dough covered. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with another piece of parchment. Continue rolling dough balls and placing on the baking sheet separating layers of rolled dough with additional sheets of parchment as needed. Cover stack of dough rounds with plastic wrap and set aside.  Sprinkle a pizza peel with some cornmeal and place a dough round on the peel. Give the peel a little shake to make sure that the dough moves freely and is not sticking. Using a pastry brush lightly brush about 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over the pizza base. Sprinkle with some salt garlic and rosemary.  Grate some of each of the cheeses onto the dough. Part of the fun of making pizzas at home is being creative. If there is one cheese you like more than the rest go a little heavy with that cheese.   Open the oven and slide the pizza off of the peel onto the pizza stone.  Allow your pizza to cook until you have reached your desired crust. Remove the pizza from the oven and place on a cutting board. If you let the pizza rest for 1 to 2 minutes it will be easier to cut.   Tips for Using a Pizza Stone   Before its first use wash the stone with water. Never use detergent.  Place the stone in a cold oven and preheat the oven. Typically pizza is baked at the maximum oven temperature between 500 to 550-degrees. Store the stone on the lowest rack of the oven so it's always handy for baking pizza or bread. Do not use the stone to bake breads with high-fat content because the fat will stain the porous stone.  Tips for Using a Pizza Peel   To prevent sticking sprinkle the peel with flour cornmeal or semolina before sliding it under the uncooked pizza crust or loaf of bread.  Place the pizza-shaped dough on the peel and then add the toppings.  Reach the peel into the oven and angle it downward. Shake it gently until the pizza slowly slides off the peel onto the stone. To retrieve the finished pizza slide the peel under the crust and guide it onto the peel.

Sous Vide Brussels Sprouts with Pearl Onions,Sansaire,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Sous Vide Brussels Sprouts with Pearl Onions,1 serving,Brussels Sprouts: 6 cups Brussels sprouts halved with outer leaves removed 2 cups butter cubed* 6 cloves garlic smashed 1 teaspoon Tabascoreserved  (Chipotle flavor)   3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  Pearl Onions: 4 cups pearl or Cipollini onions 4 tablespoons butter cubed*  3/4 cup golden raisins 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  *If you aren't using a vacuum sealer melt the butter before bagging then use the water displacement method to remove air from the bag to seal (see below for details).  ,Celebrated by chefs from Heston Blumenthal to Thomas Keller cooking sous vide calls for slowly heating vacuum-sealed food in water at low temperatures locking in natural juices and flavors lost with other methods. The Sansaire Sous-Vide immersion circulator makes it easy to prepare dishes in advance and deliver them piping-hot to the table.  This recipe was tested with the Sansaire immersion water circulator. Please consult your owner's manual for proper cooking times food handling and safety procedures.   Brussels Sprouts: Preheat your water bath to 185 degrees F (85 degrees C).   Toss all ingredients together in a large bowl to combine.   Transfer ingredients to a 1-gallon vacuum bag and seal with vacuum sealer.*  Cook sprouts in the water bath until they are tender about 1 hour. When done carefully transfer onto a platter and serve immediately.   If making ahead of time remove the bag from the bath and chill quickly by plunging it into a bowl of ice water. Store refrigerated for up to 5 days.  *Using the water displacement method: If you aren't using a vacuum sealer melt the butter before adding to the other ingredients. With the top of the bag open use tongs to carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out and form a seal around the vegetables. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag.  Pearl Onions: Preheat your water bath to 185 degrees F (85 degrees C). You may also cook in the same bath as the Brussels sprouts.  Toss all ingredients together in a large bowl to combine.   Transfer ingredients to a 1-gallon vacuum bag and seal with vacuum sealer or use water displacement method.   Cook onions until they are tender about 1 hour. When done carefully transfer onto a platter and serve immediately.    Note: If making ahead of time remove the bag from the bath and chill quickly by plunging it into a bowl of ice water. Store refrigerated for up to 5 days then reheat when ready to serve.   Get the recipe for Sous Vide Turkey Breast with Dark Meat Confit and Gravy »

Smoky Espresso Baby Back Pork Ribs,Charlie Palmer Remington Camp Cooking,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Smoky Espresso Baby Back Pork Ribs,6 servings,2 racks baby back pork ribs 5 tablespoons Remington Smoky Espresso Pepper Rub Remington Sweet & Spicy Chipotle Molasses BBQ Sauce for serving (optional)   ,The secret to these mouth-watering ribs is Charlie Palmer's special rub which combines chocolaty espresso smoky Basque peppers sweet molasses and fiery chili powder to create an intricate well balanced blend of spices.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Cut each rack of ribs in half to create four 6-rib sections. Pat the meat dry with paper towels. Rub both sides of the meat with the Smoky Espresso Pepper Rub.  Cut 8 rectangles of heavy-duty foil each at least 8 inches longer than a rib section. To create four foil packets place each rib section in the center of one foil sheet meat side down. Fold in the vertical ends first and then the horizontal sides crimping as you go so the packet is airtight and lying closely against the ribs. Repeat with the second piece of foil to double wrap and keep the steam inside. This really tenderizes the meat through the cooking process and keeps the rendered fat in keeping the ribs moist.   Place the packets on two sheet pans making sure the ribs are meat side down so the meat will be cooking in the fat-almost braising. Bake in the preheated oven until the meat is very tender about 90 minutes. (You can stick a meat fork straight through the foil into the meat to test if it is fork tender; just don't do this until you are fairly sure they are done or you'll have holes in the foil too early. Also try not to punch through the bottom layer of foil and let the fat leak out.) When the meat is very tender remove the pans from the oven. Let them cool and rest for 20 minutes.   You now have three options:  DIG IN: Carefully open the packets (some blistering steam may still be in there as well as a good accumulation of hot fat at the bottom) transfer the ribs to a cutting board and carve in between the bones. Then try to get the individual ribs to a serving platter before people get grabby.   PACK OUT: Chill the ribs right in their packets place in sealable bags and pack in a cooler for travel to a campsite. Leaving them in the packets reheat on an open-fire grill over low to medium heat. Proceed to "Dig In."  GRILL UP: From either out of the oven or cooled and packed. For some extra-added char flavor: open the packets remove the ribs from the foil and lay meat side down over a hot open-fire grill; don't move them until the surface of the meat crisps about 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and brown the bone side until heated through. Carve and serve.

Classic Croissants,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Classic Croissants,24 croissants,Dough Block (Detrempe):  1/2 cup (4 ounces) warm whole milk (110 degrees  to 115 degrees F) 1 teaspoon plus 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) sugar 4 teaspoons active dry yeast or 1 tablespoon instant yeast 4 cups (20 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons salt  1/2 stick (2 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into small pieces 1 cup (8 ounces) cold milk   Butter Block (Beurrage): 3 1/2 sticks (14 ounces) cold unsalted butter 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unbleached all-purpose flour 1 large egg 1 tablespoon whole milk or cream   ,Make the dough block:  Pour the warm milk into a small bowl and whisk in 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Whisk in the yeast and set aside for 10 minutes.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment combine the flour remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar the salt and cold butter pieces until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Add the yeast mixture and the cold milk. Switch to the dough hook and mix on lowest speed for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Knead the dough 3 to 5 times. Refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes. Make the butter block:  Cut the butter into  1/2-inch pieces toss with the flour and refrigerate for 20 minutes. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the floured butter on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes until the butter and flour form a smooth mass. Scrape the butter onto a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap and refrigerate while you roll out the dough. Incorporate the butter into the dough: Dust the work surface with flour. Set the dough in the center. Roll the dough into a 15 by 12-inch rectangle with a short side parallel to the edge of your work surface. Spread the cold but pliable butter evenly over the top two sections of dough leaving the bottom third empty and leaving a  1/2-inch border around the edges of the buttered sections.   Use a letter fold to encase the butter:  Fold the empty bottom third up over the center third of the dough. Then fold the top third down over the center. Refrigerate for 1 hour before continuing with the second turn.   Dust the dough with flour and roll it into a 20 by 12-inch rectangle. Fold the dough using the book-fold method: Fold the two short edges into the center of the dough leaving a  3/4-inch crevice between them. Now fold one side over the other as though you were closing a book. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator dust with flour and roll again into a 20 by 12-inch rectangle. Fold the dough using the letter-fold method: Visually divide the dough lengthwise into 3 equal 5-inchwide sections. Fold the bottom third up over the center of the dough and then fold the top third down over the center. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.  Cut the dough:  Roll the dough on a floured surface into a 26 by 14 by  3/4-inchthick rectangle. Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise to form two pieces that each measure 26 by 7 inches. On each piece use a ruler and paring knife to make nicks along the top edge of the dough every 4 inches. Along the bottom edge measure 2 inches in from the left side and make a nick; then add a nick every 4 inches.  Now cut the dough into triangles:  Line up your ruler with the top left corner and the first bottom nick. Cut along this line. Next line up the ruler with the first nick on the top edge and the left corner bottom and cut along that line Then cut a line from the first nick on top to the first nick on the bottom to form the second triangle. Continue cutting until the whole sheet.  Shape the dough:  Line the baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Make a 1-inch vertical slit in the center of the bottom edge of each triangle. Now roll the entire triangle toward the tip.   Wash with egg and proof:  In a small bowl lightly beat the eggs and milk. Brush each croissant evenly with the egg wash. Allow the croissants to rise until they are nearly doubled in size 1 to 2 hours.   Bake the croissants:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and position a rack in the center. Chill the croissants in the freezer for 10 minutes or in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Brush the croissants once more with the egg wash. Bake one baking sheet at a time rotating it halfway through for 17 to 22 minutes until the croissants are a deep golden brown. Transfer the croissants to a rack to cool.

Stuffed Artichokes with Pine Nuts and Currants,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Stuffed Artichokes with Pine Nuts and Currants,4 servings,3 tablespoons dried currants  1/2 cup hot water 2 lemons 4 large artichokes 4 cups plain focaccia crumbs from about  1/2 pound day-old focaccia  1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino cheese 2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 large plum (Roma type) tomato grated  2 cloves garlic minced  3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil  3/4 cup pine nuts toasted  Scant 1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt Freshly ground black pepper   ,With their leaves spread to embrace the filling these hefty artichokes resemble pompom chrysanthemums - a reminder that they are in fact flower buds. Stuffed with garlicky focaccia crumbs a single one makes a satisfying lunch.  Put the currants in a small bowl add the hot water and let soften for 20 minutes. Drain.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Fill a large bowl with cold water and add the juice of 1 lemon. Cut the other lemon in half.  Working with 1 artichoke at a time cut off the stem flush with the base. Rub the base with a lemon half to prevent browning. With a serrated knife slice off the top 1 inch of the artichoke; rub the exposed surface with lemon. With scissors snip off the pointed tips of the remaining leaves. With your fingers carefully pry open the center of the artichoke to reveal the pale prickly inner leaves and fuzzy choke taking care not to break any leaves. Pull out the innermost prickly leaves then use a small spoon or melon baller to scrape the hairy choke from the artichoke bottom. Squeeze some lemon juice into the cavity and drop the trimmed artichoke into the lemon water. If necessary invert a plate over the artichoke to keep it submerged. Repeat with the remaining artichokes.  In a large bowl combine the focaccia crumbs cheese parsley and dried oregano crumbling the dried herb between your fingers. Add the tomato garlic olive oil pine nuts currants salt and several grinds of pepper. Mix well with our hands. Measure the volume of the filling so that you can put one-quarter of the volume in each artichoke.  Remove the artichokes from the lemon water and invert on paper towels briefly to drain excess water. With your fingers fill the center cavities with some of the stuffing then tuck more stuffing between the leaves. The inner leaves are too close together to separate without breaking them but pack stuffing between leaves where you can.  Set a rack inside a deep baking dish large enough to hold the artichokes. Stand the artichokes upright on the rack then add boiling water to a depth of ½ inch to the dish. Cover the artichokes with a sheet of parchment paper then cover the baking dish tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.  Bake until you can pull a leaf out easily 1 to 1 3/4 hours. Taste the leaf and make sure the base is tender. Let cool for at least 20 minutes before serving. The artichokes are best when warm not hot.

Carrot Soup with Lemongrass,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/soups-stews/vegetarian/Carrot Soup with Lemongrass,6 to 8 servings,3 lemongrass stalks 3 tablespoons unsalted butter  3/4 cup thinly sliced shallots 2 pounds carrots peeled and sliced  1/2-inch thick 1 1/2 quarts chicken or vegetable broth (if canned use equal parts broth and water) plus more if needed Kosher or sea salt Thinly sliced fresh chives for garnish   ,With an aroma that fuses lemon ginger and mint lemongrass lurks in the background here. Tasters may not identify the fragrance but they know the carrots are getting an assist. Because the carrot flavor is delicate make sure your broth is not too intense. A tip from Vicki Westerhoff of Genesis Growers: “When our carrots are coming in fresh with awesome greens I always make carrot top soup. You can also use the greens sparingly in juicing and in salads.  To trim the lemongrass cut off the fibrous leafy tops and the hard base from each stalk. Cut the trimmed stalks into 3-inch lengths. With the side of a cleaver or a rolling pin smash the stalks firmly enough to break the fibers.  Melt the butter in a large pot over moderate heat. Add the shallots and sautŽ until softened about 3 minutes. Add the carrots broth and 6 pieces of the lemongrass and bring to a simmer. Taste and add more lemongrass if you don't perceive a subtle lemony-gingery taste. When you are satisfied that you have added enough lemongrass partially cover the pot and simmer gently until the carrots are cooked about 25 minutes.  Remove the lemongrass pieces with tongs and let the soup cool slightly. Puree in a blender or food processor until smooth in batches in necessary. Return the soup to a large clean pot and thin if desired with more broth or with water. Season with salt. Reheat to serve and divide among warmed soup bowls. Garnish each portion with the chives.

Irish Apple and Parsnip Soup,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/soups-stews/vegetarian/Irish Apple and Parsnip Soup,4 servings,4 ounces unsalted butter 1 large shallot minced 1 leek (white part only) halved lengthwise washed and dried cut into  3/4 inch pieces 1 clove garlic crushed 1 large ( 3/4-pound) Yukon Gold potato peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 2 parsnips (about  1/2-pound) peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 2 Granny Smith apples peeled cored and chopped into 2-inch pieces 5 cups vegetable broth 2 cups apple juice 1 cup whole milk  1/2 cup flat leaf parsley Kosher salt and freshly black pepper   ,Parsnips and turnips were used extensively in rural Ireland to give variety to meals in the winter when green vegetables were in little supply. Surprisingly this vegetarian soup is a wonderful balance of sweet apple flavors with parsnip overtones. I prefer to use Granny Smith apples as they have a little more acidic flavor which rounds out the richness of this soup. Serve soup on its own or with a slice of Irish soda bread.  Place a large saucepan on the stove over a medium heat. Add the butter and when melted add shallots leeks and garlic and using a wooden spoon to occasionally stir. Cook until leeks are tender about 7 minutes.   Add the potato parsnips and apples and cook until just potatoes are starting to soften about 5 minutes.   Add the broth and apple juice; reduce stove temperature to a simmer. Cover the saucepan and cook until the vegetables are very soft about 30 minutes.

Warm Cranberry Crumble Tart,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Warm Cranberry Crumble Tart,1 serving,Flaky pie or tart dough: Click here for recipe »  Filling: 5 cups (20 ounces) fresh cranberries  3/4 cup (5 3/4 ounces) sugar Finely grated zest of 1 medium orange 4 teaspoons unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  Topping: 1 cup (5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour  3/4 cup (5 3/4 ounces) sugar  3/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces Vanilla ice cream for serving   ,When the crisp fall air brings fresh cranberries to market this tart will celebrate the season. Dressy enough for company comforting enough for a night in front of the fire it should be served warm with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream alongside. The sweet crumble topping is a fine partner to the tart cranberries within. If you'd like to add a little more crunch stir 1/3 cup coarsely chopped nuts into the crumble topping (walnuts and almonds would be especially good).  Trim and finish the tart dough: Use the scissors to trim the dough so it overhangs the edge of the tart pan by 1 inch. Moisten the inside wall of dough with your finger dipped in cool water. Fold the overhanging dough inward to form a sturdy double-layered edge. Press firmly with your thumbs to fuse the two layers of dough then roll your thumb over the rim of the tart to remove any excess dough there. Chill while the oven preheats.  Bake the shell: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and position an oven rack in the lower third. Line the chilled tart shell with heavy-duty foil pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 20 to 22 minutes until the foil comes away from the dough easily (if it doesn't bake another 5 to 6 minutes and check again). Remove the pan from the oven (hold the pan by the sides and not the bottom) close the oven door and lift out the foil and weights from the shell; set them aside to cool. Return the pan to the oven to continue baking the shell for about 10 minutes then remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and check to see if any cracks have formed. If you see a crack very gently smear a tiny bit of reserved dough over the crack to patch it-you need only enough to seal the opening. Return the pan to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer until the crust is a nice golden brown all over. Transfer to a rack and cool completely.  Mix the filling: Coarsely chop half of the cranberries by hand with a chef's knife or with a few pulses in the bowl of the food processor. In the medium bowl combine the chopped cranberries whole cranberries sugar orange zest flour and cinnamon and stir to blend well.   Use a silicone or rubber spatula to scrape the filling into the cooled tart shell.  Mix the topping: Place the flour sugar and salt in the bowl of the stand mixer. Add the cold butter and mix on medium-low speed until the mixture begins to form clumps the size of small peas (some will still look a little sandy which is fine). This step may also be done by hand in the cleaned medium bowl pinching the butter between your fingers or cutting it with a pastry blender until small clumps form.  Cover the filling evenly with the topping.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake the tart for 40 minutes until the fruit is soft and bubbling and the topping is golden brown. Transfer to a cooling rack making sure you hold the pan by the sides and not the bottom (remember it's a two-piece pan and can come apart!). Cool for 20 minutes before serving. Or cool completely then reheat just before serving.  Place the tart pan on top of a large can from your pantry (the 28-ounce tomato cans are good) so that the bottom balances midair as the rim falls to the counter. Use the large metal spatula to transfer the tart to a serving plate or simply leave the bottom of the tart pan under the tart for support. Slice the tart with a thin sharp knife and serve warm with vanilla ice cream.  Storing: The tart keeps for 1 day at room temperature. For longer storage cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Allow 1 hour for the tart to come to room temperature or reheat in a 350 degrees F oven for 12 to 15 minutes

Sous Vide Smoked Brisket,Courtesy of Anova,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Sous Vide Smoked Brisket,10 servings,1 flat- or point-cut brisket about 5 pounds 2 oz. coarsely ground black peppercorns (about  1/3-cup)  2  3/4 oz. kosher salt (about  3/4-cup)   3/4 tsp. liquid smoke (optional)   3/4 oz. pink salt (optional)  Dill pickles sliced yellow onion and white bread for serving   ,Start by grinding a half cup of whole black peppercorns using a burr grinder a pepper mill or a food processor. You're looking for a coarse grind but not so coarse that identifiable peppercorns remain.  Combine the pepper with  3/4-cup of kosher salt and rub it evenly over every surface of the brisket. If you're using pink salt add 1 tablespoon of pink salt (about 10 grams) to the rub before applying it.  Chances are your brisket will be too large to fit in a single vacuum or resealable zipper locking bag. Split it in half crosswise to allow it to fit.  Place the brisket inside a vacuum sealer or resealable zipper locking bag. (Fold over the top while you add the meat so that no juices get on the edge of the bag which can weaken the seal.) Add a half teaspoon of liquid smoke and to the bag if you're using the liquid smoke method. Don't worry much about distributing the liquid smoke evenly over the beef; it'll spread around during cooking no matter where you add it. Seal the bag using a vacuum sealer. If using pink salt let the beef rest for three to four hours in the refrigerator before proceeding.  Set the temperature on your Precision Cooker to 155 degrees F for traditionally moist and tender brisket or for 135 degrees F for brisket that has a meatier more steak-like texture.  Add brisket to water bath and cover it with a lid aluminum foil or table tennis balls. Cook for 24 to 36 hours at 155 degrees F or 36 to 72 hours at 135 degrees F.  When the brisket has finished cooking remove from bags and carefully blot dry with paper towels. (Liquid from bags can be added to your favorite barbecue sauce and simmered down to provide extra flavor.) Allow cooked brisket to cool at least to room temperature before proceeding (an ice bath can speed up this process). Brisket can be stored in the refrigerator at this stage for up to 1 week before finishing.  Finishing steps – smoker: Light  1/2 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively set half the burners on a gas grill to medium-high heat cover and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate. Rub reserved salt and pepper mixture into surface of brisket and then place it on cooler side of grill.  Add 4 to 5 hardwood chunks to hotter side of grill. Cover and cook adding a few pieces of wood and coals as necessary and maintaining the air intake valves to try and keep the cooker hovering at around 275- to 300 degrees F at all times. Add 2 to 3 wood chunks twice during cooking.  Keep cooking until the brisket has achieved a deep dark bark about 3 hours.  Transfer brisket to a cutting board and tent with foil. Allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice against the grain into thin strips and serve.  Finishing steps – oven:Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300 degrees F. If your oven has a convection setting turn it on and adjust heat to 275 degrees F instead. Rub reserved salt and pepper mixture into surface of brisket and place them on a foil-rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack placed in it.  Cook until the exterior achieves a dark mahogany bark about 2 hours.  Transfer brisket to a cutting board and tent with foil. Allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice against the grain into thin strips and serve.

Stir to combine. Let slaw sit at room temperature while you make the burgers.   Make the sauce: In a small bowl stir together mayonnaise mustard and maple syrup. Season with salt and pepper. Set sauce aside.   Make the burgers: Heat butter (or oil) in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetables. Season with salt and pepper and cook stirring frequently until vegetables are soft and start to brown. Add garlic cook for about 30 more seconds. Remove from heat and let cool completely.   In a large bowl add cooked vegetables turkey and beans. Season with more salt and pepper. Using your hands or a spatula mash everything together until just combined (don't overmix). Form into 6 burger patties.  Grill the burgers: Clean grill grates and rub grates with a cloth dipped in vegetable oil. Light grill to medium-high heat. Alternately heat an indoor grill pan or cast iron skillet. Grill burgers for about 4 minutes per side until internal temperature when tested with a thermometer reaches 165 degrees F. When burgers are almost done top with cheese and cover to allow cheese to melt. Remove from grill keep warm.  Put burger buns cut side down on grill until lightly toasted. Assemble burgers in buns topped with slaw and sauce.   Notes: Joel and Sally used a combination of onions mushrooms Swiss chard carrots and white beans in their burger. They topped it with sharp Vermont cheddar of course!  This hybrid meat and veggie burger is a "gateway" to the world of veggie burgers. The key to keeping these burgers together are the mashed beans. Play around with the ratio of vegetables to meat to beans. Or opt for no meat for a veggie option.   Try wrapping your burger in a collard chard lettuce or cabbage leaf like Sally!   Note on whey:  Whey is the watery remains from the formation of cheese curds or other dairy products. Whey is a byproduct of cheese making. Save the cheese whey when making ricotta or visit your local cheese shop and ask for some! You can also strain plain yogurt and use yogurt whey for a similarly tangy flavor. If you can't get whey but need to try this slaw substitute buttermilk.

Pappardelle Pasta Dough,Ethan Stowell,home/recipes/breads/dough/Pappardelle Pasta Dough,4 servings,3 cups Italian "00" flour 3 eggs 3 egg yolks Pinch salt 2 tablespoons water 1 tablespoon olive oil   ,Freshly made pasta puts the dried variety to shame. This easy-to-follow recipe will have you making your own noodles at home in no time.  Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer like the Kenwood Chef Kitchen Machine fitted with a dough hook. Mix on a low speed until the dough comes together into a ball. Continue to mix for about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove dough from the bowl wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature for at least an hour.   Attach a pasta roller attachment to your stand mixer.   Once the dough has rested remove the plastic and divide it into two or four equal parts. Press the dough down with your fingertips to make a rectangle shape as thin as you can. Turn the pasta roller setting to its thickest setting. Set the machine to a low speed and feed the pasta through the roller until it is all the way through. Turn the speed up to its next highest setting and repeat the process cycling up through the speeds until you have a thin sheet of dough. If the pasta gets sticky at all sprinkle a little flour on it and continue.   Once you have one long sheet of pasta cut it into 10-12-inch sheets. Then cut those sheets lengthwise into 1-inch thick noodles. Lightly dust the pasta with flour and lay out on the cookie sheet until you plan on cooking it. Repeat with the remaining dough.   Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt. Add the pasta and stir so it does not stick together. Cook uncovered at a rolling boil stirring occasionally for about 6-7 minutes or until al dente. Strain and mix with your sauce.    
King Arthur Flour's No-Knead Crusty White Bread,King Arthur Flour Company Inc.,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/King Arthur Flour's No-Knead Crusty White Bread,3 to 4 loaves,3 cups lukewarm water 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 cups Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 1/2 tbsp. instant yeast  3/4 cup milk for brushing    ,The most basic of all no-knead loaves this is a wonderful way to get into yeast-bread baking. The easy stir-together dough rests in your refrigerator developing flavor all the time till you're ready to bake. About 90 minutes before you want to serve bread grab a handful of dough shape it let it rise then bake for 30 minutes. The result? Incredible crusty artisan-style bread. If you're a first-time bread baker you'll never believe this bread came out of your own oven. If you're a seasoned yeastie you'll love this recipe's simplicity.  The flour/liquid ratio is important in this recipe. If you measure flour by sprinkling it into your measuring cup then gently sweeping off the excess use 7 1/2 cups. If you measure flour by dipping your cup into the canister then use 6 1/2 cups. Most accurate of all and guaranteed to give you the best results if you measure flour by weight use 32 ounces.  Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl or a large (6-quart) food-safe plastic bucket. For first timers "lukewarm" means about 105 degrees but don't stress over getting the temperatures exact here. Comfortably warm is fine. "OUCH that is hot!" is not. Yeast is a living thing treat it nicely.  Mix and stir everything together to make a very sticky rough dough. If you have a stand mixer beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60 seconds. If you don't have a mixer just stir-stir-stir with a wooden spoon or dough whisk until everything is combined.  Next you're going to let the dough rise. If you've made the dough in a plastic bucket you're all set-just let it stay there covering the bucket with a lid or plastic wrap; a shower cap actually works well here. Transfer the dough to a large bowl as it will rise significantly. There is no need to grease the bowl though you can if you like; it makes it a bit easier to get the dough out when it's time to bake the bread.  Cover the bowl and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours or for up to about 7 days. (If you are pressed for time skip the room temperature rise and stick it right into the fridge.) The longer you keep the dough in the fridge the tangier it'll get; if you chill it for 7 days it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so it'll rise and then fall. That's OK; that's what it's supposed to do.  When you're ready to make the bread sprinkle the top of the dough with flour; this will make it easier to grab a hunk. Grease your hands and pull off about  3/4 to  1/3 of the dough-a 14-ounce to 19-ounce piece if you have a scale. It'll be about the size of a softball or a large grapefruit.  Plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface and round it into a ball or a longer log. Don't fuss around trying to make it perfect; just do the best you can.  Place the dough on  a piece of parchment (if you're going to use a baking stone); or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top; this will help keep the dough moist as it rests before baking.  Let the dough rise for about 45 to 60 minutes. It won't appear to rise upwards that much; rather it'll seem to settle and expand. Preheat your oven (and baking stone if you're using one) to 450 degrees while the dough rests. Place a shallow metal or cast iron pan (not glass Pyrex or ceramic) on the lowest rack and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go.  If you are using a bread cloche do not pre-heat your oven and skip to the method below.  When you're ready to bake take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times making a cut about  1/2" deep. The bread may deflate a bit; that's O 
Thyme-Scented Potato Gratin,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Thyme-Scented Potato Gratin,8 to 10 servings,3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes 2 large leeks white and light green parts only washed well and thinly sliced 6 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves divided  1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese  3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 4 tablespoons unsalted butter divided plus more for greasing baking dish 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup whole milk 1 tablespoon kosher salt  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper   ,This elegant side dish classic is a crowd pleaser for any occasion. Make sure to wash the leeks thoroughly since they often contain sand in between the layers. But don't rinse the potato slices since the starch on their surfaces helps to bind and thicken the gratin. Use a mandoline to cut the potatoes into thin even slices.  Place 2 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan and heat over medium heat. Add leeks and saute until softened but not browned about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add cream and milk to the saucepan and heat until mixture simmers. Add salt and white pepper stirring well to combine. Peel potatoes and place a mandoline across the top of the saucepan. Slice potatoes into 1/8-inch thick slices directly into hot cream mixture. Press potato slices gently with a silicone spatula to submerge. Cook undisturbed until potatoes are partially cooked and mixture begins to thicken about 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in 3 tablespoons thyme leaves.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and place a rack in the center. Generously grease a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish with butter. Combine cheeses in a small mixing bowl. Using a slotted spoon or spider carefully transfer the potato slices to the prepared baking dish. Carefully pour enough cream mixture to barely cover potatoes. Dot with remaining 2 tablespoons butter and cover with remaining cheese mixture.   Bake in preheated oven until casserole bubbles around the edges potatoes are tender and the top is golden brown about 50 to 60 minutes. If the top begins to brown too deeply before potatoes are cooked cover gratin with aluminum foil. If the top has not browned when potatoes are cooked place gratin under a preheated broiler for 2 to 3 minutes continuously watching to ensure it doesn't burn.   Allow gratin to sit for at least 20 minutes before serving.  To serve: Sprinkle gratin with remaining 3 tablespoons thyme leaves. Slice gratin into serving portions and transfer to serving plates. Serve immediately.

It was a sweeping swirling and ambitious dream that lived inside us-alongside us. We ate a lot of cake. We drank a lot of coffee. By turns gradually and impulsively we honed the concept. First we fell in love with a neighborhood: Red Hook Brooklyn. It is the kind of neighborhood that doesn't much exist in New York City anymore. It is the kind of neighborhood that still feels special small local artistic unusual and most important neighborly. Then we fell in love with a space that needed a lot of love. Thankfully it was in the heart of Red Hook on the heart of Van Brunt Street. In the summer of 2004 we set about piecing together our physical bakery. Slowly (perhaps much too slowly) the form began to take shape. After several months of nonstop mania tears exhaustion and small triumphs we proudly birthed our baby. Baked opened to the public on January 1 2005.  We mark the occasion of our store opening aka Baked's Birthday every year. We usually do so with a lot of cake. We hope you will celebrate this happy occasion with us by making this cake. This is a very happy cake. This is the kind of birthday cake that turns gray skies blue; it is also very very tasty. Obviously our Very Vanilla Sprinkle Cake is full of vanilla. Vanilla is often the more stately less sinful sister to our beloved chocolate but it is just as powerful and enchanting in larger-than-average doses. We liberally applied vanilla to both the light white sponge cake and the smooth rich frosting. Then-because we absolutely couldn't help ourselves-we filled and covered the whole cake with a rainbow explosion of sprinkles. The visual effect is a bit ridiculous and absolutely necessary.  Baked note: If you like to decorate cakes you might want to invest in a sturdy cake turntable. While you don't absolutely need one it will certainly help to achieve smooth cakes special swirls and well…it makes adding the sprinkles to this cake a whole lot more fun.  Make the Very Vanilla Cake:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter three 8-inch (20-cm) round cake pans line the bottoms with parchment paper and butter the parchment. Dust with flour and knock out the excess flour.  Sift both flours the baking powder baking soda and salt together into a large bowl. Set aside.  In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the butter and shortening on medium speed until creamy 3 to 4 minutes. Add the sugar and vanilla and beat on medium speed until fluffy about 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl add the egg and beat until just combined.  In a small bowl whisk together the ice-cold water milk and buttermilk.  Add the flour mixture to the mixer bowl in three separate additions alternating with the water mixture beginning and ending with the flour mixture; turn the mixer to low when you add the ingredients then up to medium for a few seconds to incorporate. Scrape down the bowl then mix on low speed for a few more seconds. Remove the bowl from the standing mixer scatter the sprinkles across the top of the batter and fold them in with a rubber spatula.  In a medium bowl whisk the egg whites and cream of tartar just until soft peaks form; do not overbeat. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter with a rubber spatula.  Divide the batter among the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes rotating the pans halfway through the baking time until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack and let cool for 20 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the rack remove from the pans and let cool complete

Homemade Pumpkin Pie,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Homemade Pumpkin Pie,1 (10-inch) regular pie or 1 (9-inch) deep-dish pie,1 recipe Perfect Pie Crust  3 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon ground ginger  3/4 teaspoon grated whole nutmeg (about 20 grates on a whole nutmeg)   3/4 teaspoon ground cloves  3/4 teaspoon ground allspice  1/8 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) heavy whipping cream  1/2 cup (4 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar 2 cups (16 ounces) canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)  Whipped cream for serving   , Thanksgiving just may be everyone's favorite holiday. After all what's better than a day completely devoted to a delicious feast shared by family and friends all giving thanks for their blessings? This recipe takes an American classic to celebration status with a careful blend of spices and heavy cream outshining the stale spice mix and evaporated milk of less enchanting recipes. Ever notice how spices clump up and don't blend well when added to a custard? The trick is to blend them first with the eggs whose fat helps the clumps disperse evenly before adding any liquid to the custard mixture.  To prepare the pie crust remove the dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin roll chilled dough into a circle turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking until the circle measures 14 inches wide and  1/8 inch thick. Starting at one edge roll the dough around the rolling pin and lay it gently on top of a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie pan. Gently press the dough into the bottom and sides of the pan. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough so it overhangs the edge of the pan by 1 inch. Fold the overhanging dough under itself around the pan edge then crimp or form a decorative border. Chill the lined pan for at least 30 minutes.   Preheat oven to 375 degrees and place a rack in the bottom third. Line the chilled pie shell with heavy-duty foil pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 20 to 22 minutes until the foil comes away from the dough easily (if it doesn't then bake another 5 to 6 minutes and check again). Remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and lift out the foil and weights from the shell; set them aside to cool. Return the pan to the oven to continue baking the shell for about 10 minutes then remove the pan from the oven close the oven door and check to see if any cracks have formed. If you see a crack very gently smear a tiny bit of reserved dough over the crack to patch it-you need only enough to seal the opening. Return the pan to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer until the crust is a nice golden brown all over. Transfer to a rack and cool slightly. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.  While the pie crust is baking make the filling. Whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl to break them up. Add cinnamon ginger nutmeg cloves allspice and salt and whisk well to blend evenly. Whisk in the cream brown sugar granulated sugar and pumpkin and blend well. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer directly into the tart shell and bake until the custard is set about 30 to 40 minutes. Test by tapping the side of the pie pan-the center of the pie should look firm and move as one piece. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool completely about 2 hours.  To serve slice the pie with a thin and sharp knife and use a pie server to transfer each slice to a plate. Serve with whipped cream.

Salmon Dill Linguine,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Salmon Dill Linguine,4 servings,Kosher salt 1 recipe Homemade Pasta Dough (see below) cut into  3/4-inch ribbons 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium shallot peeled and minced  1/2 pound smoked salmon cut into  1/2-inch cubes   3/4 cup heavy whipping cream  3/4 cup water  3/4 cup capers drained and rinsed 1 teaspoon lemon zest 2 tablespoon lemon juice more according to taste Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons minced dill   Homemade Pasta Dough Yields 4 servings. If you can find Italian "00" flour use it to make very delicate yet chewy pasta. If not all-purpose flour works really well.   2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour or "00" flour plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon kosher salt 4 large eggs 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil    ,Linguine is sometimes referred to as Trenette pasta. These narrow  3/4-inch wide long ribbons have a broad surface for holding sauce and are well-suited to cream based sauces.  To make the homemade pasta: Place flour and salt in a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Make a "well" in the center of the flour mixture and add eggs and oil. Using your fingers blend the eggs into the flour mixture stirring the flour in from the sides of the well and working outwards.   When the pasta dough is thoroughly mixed turn it out on a lightly floured work surface. Knead dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky adding small amounts of flour as needed about 5 minutes. Gather the dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes at room temperature.  To roll dough secure a pasta machine to the edge of a long countertop. Using a bench scraper cut the dough into thirds. Keep extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with one piece. Flatten the piece of dough into a rough rectangle so that it will fit inside the width of the pasta machine. Place the rollers on the widest setting and roll the dough through the machine catching it with one hand as you roll with the other. Take the dough and fold into thirds towards the center of the dough. Turn the dough so one open end faces the machine and roll it through on the widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting. Continue rolling the pasta through the machine without folding adjusting the rollers to the next smallest setting each time until the desired thickness is reached. If the pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.   Cut sheets to  3/4 inch wide long ribbons toss with flour and set aside covered with a clean kitchen towel. The pasta can be cooked immediately or covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to an hour before use.    To cook pasta: Heat a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add enough kosher salt to season the water to taste like sea water. While salted water boils vigorously add linguine and stir immediately to prevent pasta from sticking together. Boil until pasta is al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta water and drain pasta through a colander.   To prepare pasta sauce: Place a large skillet on the stove over medium heat and add oil. When the oil is shimmering add the shallot and cook until tender about 2 minutes. Add the smoked salmon and continue to cook until the salmon is warmed through 1 to 2 minutes.   Pour in the cream and water and allow to bubble. Add the capers and cook until the sauce thickens about 3 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest and juice and then add the cooked linguine to the skillet and toss until thoroughly combined. If the sauce is too thick add some of the reserved pasta water to thin the sauce. Remove the skillet from the heat taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.   To serve: Divide the pasta between 4 warmed pasta bowls sprinkle with minced dill and serve immediately.

Braised Veal Breast with Pearl Onions and Artichokes,Jacques Pepin Heart & Soul in the Kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Braised Veal Breast with Pearl Onions and Artichokes,4 servings,12 ounces pearl onions (about 20)  One 9-ounce box frozen artichoke hearts 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 bone-in veal breast (3 to 4 pounds)  1 teaspoon salt  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped onions 12 peeled garlic cloves 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour  1/2 cup homemade chicken stock or canned low-sodium chicken broth  1/2 cup dry white wine 1 fresh thyme sprig 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives   ,While they are not always easy to find veal breasts are inexpensive. There is a fair amount of meat around the bones and cartilage and the taste is superb. Cover the pearl onions for 1 1/2 cups water in a saucepan and boil gently for 10 to 12 minutes until tender. Drain. Combine the onions with the frozen artichokes and set aside.  Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.  Heat the butter in a Dutch oven or enameled cast-iron cocotte until hot. Sprinkle the veal breast all over with the salt and pepper place it in the hot butter and brown over medium-high heat for a good 15 minutes turning the veal to brown it on all sides. Transfer the meat to a plate.  Add the chopped onions and garlic to the drippings in the pot and cook for 1 minute stirring. Sprinkle the flour on top and mix well. Add the stock wine thyme and bay leaves mix well and bring to a boil.  Add the veal cover and bring to a boil. Transfer the pot to the oven and braise for about 3 hours. (This recipe can be prepared ahead to this point and the veal set aside for up to 1 day. Bring to a simmer before proceeding.)  At serving time transfer the pot to the stovetop add the boiled onions and artichokes and boil gently for 10 to 15 minutes. Slice the veal and serve on hot plates with the onions artichokes and a lot of the braising liquid sprinkled with the chives.   
Sous Vide Steak,Sansaire,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Sous Vide Steak,1 serving,Steak 3 tablespoons soy sauce 3 tablespoons fish sauce 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon blue cheese  1/2 teaspoon anchovy paste   ,Sous vide is ridiculously useful for barbecue and grilling situations. Because different meats take different times to cook and because nobody wants to under- or overcook their meats we always cook everything until done sous vide then slap it on a hot grill just to finish. The results are phenomenal. You get the same romanticism of traditional grilling but with vastly better results. Plus since all your food is cooked ahead of time and hanging out in a warm bath when people get hungry it only takes a few minutes to feed the crowd.  Mix ingredients to combine add to bag with steak. Follow guidance at Sansaire.com/steak for cooking temperature and time.  Recommend using flank steak skirt steak or tri-tip. For tri-tip (thick steaks) cook for 4 hours minimum up to 24 hours.   Finish over a super-hot grill. 
Wild Mushroom Risotto with Fried Sage,Recipe Developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Wild Mushroom Risotto with Fried Sage,4 servings,6 to 8 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth  1 tablespoon olive oil 4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter divided  1/2 pound assorted wild mushrooms sliced  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 shallot minced 1 1/2 cups Arborio or Carnaroli rice  1/2 cup dry white wine 3/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese plus more for garnish   Fried sage: 8 large sage leaves  3/4 cup olive oil Sea salt   ,Pour broth into a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low and cover to keep hot.   To prepare the mushrooms: To a large skillet over medium-high heat add oil and 1 tablespoon butter. When foaming subsides add mushrooms and saute stirring occasionally until browned and any liquid they release is evaporated about 5 minutes. Season mushrooms with salt and pepper and set aside.  To a large saucepan or straight sided skillet set over medium heat add 2 tablespoons butter. When foam subsides add shallots and cook until softened and translucent about 2 minutes. Add rice and saute stirring constantly until rice is evenly coated with butter and translucent around the edges about 4 minutes. Add wine and cook until wine is almost evaporated about 3 more minutes.   To cook the risotto: Using a ladle add about 1 cup of hot broth to the rice stirring continuously with a wooden spoon. Add additional broth 1 cup at a time stirring constantly and adding more broth only after the previous addition has been absorbed. The risotto is done after about 20 minutes when it is creamy and the rice grains are plump and tender. Remove from heat and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter sauteed mushrooms and Parmesan. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  To fry the sage leaves: To a small saucepan set over medium-high heat add oil. When oil is shimmering add sage leaves and cook until crisp about 15 seconds. Transfer sage leaves to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.  To serve: Perfect risotto should flow gently when ladled into a serving dish. Adjust consistency with a little hot broth and garnish with additional Parmesan and sage leaves before serving.   
Faux-Stone Cake,Martha Stewart,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Faux-Stone Cake,one 9-inch layer cake,Two 9-inch cakes  (see Mix-and-Match  Cakes page 226) Frosting (see Mix-and-Match Frostings page 237) 3 envelopes ( 3/4 ounce each) unflavored gelatin  1/2 cup cold water 1 1/2 cups sugar 7 ounces sweetened condensed milk Pinch of kosher salt 12 ounces white chocolate coarsely chopped Gel-paste food coloring in 3 shades of blue such as Wedgwood Sky Blue and Royal Blue   ,The key to this high-gloss showstopper is combining different shades of white chocolate glaze: Pour it over the cake (we baked the Basic Chocolate on page 229) at the right temperature so it dries to a mirror-like finish. We chose three shades of blue here but you could use a different color combination to replicate your favorite stone  With a serrated knife trim tops of cake layers to level. Place a layer bottom-side down on a wire rack set over a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Spread  3/4 cup frosting evenly over cake layer. Place second layer bottom-side up on top. Spread a thin layer of frosting over cake to form a crumb coat. Chill in freezer until cold and firm about 2 hours.  In a small bowl sprinkle gelatin over cold water. Let stand until softened about 5 minutes. Meanwhile combine sugar condensed milk salt and  1/2 cup water in a small saucepan; bring to a gentle simmer over low heat. Remove from heat; stir in gelatin mixture until dissolved (mixture should feel smooth when rubbed between your fingers).  Place white chocolate in a medium bowl. Pour milk mixture over chocolate and let stand 5 minutes; mix with a spatula until combined. Using an immersion blender blend until mixture is smooth. Using a fine-mesh sieve strain mixture into a large measuring cup.  Divide mixture into 4 small bowls. Add gel a drop at a time to 3 bowls until desired shades are reached. Pour all 4 back into measuring cup(do not mix). Let glaze cool until it registers 95 degrees F on a candy thermometer.  Meanwhile place a wire rack on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Transfer chilled cake to rack elevating it on a smaller-size cake pan or sturdy bowl to allow glaze to drip down and cover sides neatly.  Using a back-and-forth motion pour glaze over cake. (Gently shake baking sheet and tap it on a counter if necessary to ensure that glaze covers cake.) Using a skewer or toothpick pop any air bubbles. Let glaze set at least 30 minutes before serving. To serve dip a knife in hot water wipe it dry and cut cake into wedges.  Reprinted from Martha Stewart's Cake Perfection Copyright Copywrite  2020 by Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia LP.

Succulent Matcha Cupcakes,Martha Stewart,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Succulent Matcha Cupcakes,1 dozen,1 cup cake flour  (not self-rising) 4 teaspoons matcha powder  1/2 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 teaspoon baking soda  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 4 tablespoons unsalted  butter room temperature  3/4 cup sugar 1 large egg  room temperature  1/2 cup whole milk Swiss Meringue  Buttercream (page 237) Gel-paste food coloring  in mint green leaf green forest green dark purple  light brown and peach   , With a steady hand and some basic piping techniques you can produce a veritable garden of edible succulents atop these green-tea-flavored cakes. Follow the decorating tips on page 192 practice on parchment before you get started and use a flower nail (available at baking-supply stores) for best results.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners. In a medium bowl whisk together flour matcha baking powder baking soda and salt.  With an electric mixer on high speed beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy about 3 minutes scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Reduce speed to medium. Add egg and mix until just combined. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in batches alternating with milk until combined.  Divide batter evenly among prepared cups filling each about halfway. Bake rotating tin halfway through until cupcakes spring back to the touch and a cake tester comes out clean about 16 minutes. Transfer tin to a wire rack to cool 5 minutes. Turn out cupcakes onto rack and let cool completely.  Divide buttercream into 5 bowls reserving a few tablespoons of plain. Add gel-paste food coloring to bowls a drop at a time to achieve desired shades of mint green leaf green forest green dark purple and light brown. (Make more of the shade you'll want to spread on the base of your cupcakes.) Using a star tip pipe vertical mounds of varying thickness to create cactus shapes. Use a very small round tip to pipe white dots along the sides or use a very small star tip to pipe a flower on top. To make the small individual succulents pipe onto a flower nail and then transfer to the cupcake. See page 192 for decorating details. (Cupcakes are best eaten the day they are baked.)  To create the succulents shown opposite follow the steps below. Use a flower nail (we used a #7) available at baking-supply stores. Adhere a small square of parchment to the surface of the flower nail with a dab of frosting. Pipe the design then gently slide the parchment off the nail onto a baking sheet and refrigerate about 20 minutes. Use a small offset spatula to transfer the designs to the cupcakes. To make them two-toned in color paint stripes of one color of buttercream along the inside of the piping bag then fill the bag with a second color buttercream.  Using a small petal tip (such as #104) squeeze the bag gently and pull up slowly to make an acorn shape on top of the parchment. Holding the tip against the point of the acorn wide end down and the narrow end angled in toward the acorn's center pipe a wide strip as you turn the nail enrobing the top completely. Continue turning the nail making longer petals that overlap.    Using a medium petal tip (such as #125) pipe a basic petal: Hold the bag at a 45-degree angle to the surface with the tip's wide end down and the narrow end pointed away slightly to the left. Move the tip forward and back again while you pivot the narrow end to the right creating a long fan-shaped petal. Pipe additional petals overlapping each one slightly. Using the same petal technique pipe smaller petals.  Using a U-shaped petal tip (such as #80 or #81) pipe a dot about  1/2 inch in diameter to form the base. Hold the bag at a 45-degree angle against the edge of the dot with the tip's U shape facing up. Apply pressure squeezing the bag while pulling out in a quick stroke. Repeat all around the dot; form three or more petal layers over the first making petals shorter with each layer.   Using a fine leaf tip (such as #352) pipe a small mound in the center of a flower nail to form the base. Holding the tip vertically against the surface with the pointed end of the leaf tip almost touching the mound apply gentle steady pressure as you pipe a leaf-shaped petal. Then decrease pressure as you pull away. Repeat with more leaf-shaped petals aro 
Braised Short Rib Tagliatelle Pasta,Quin Liburd,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Braised Short Rib Tagliatelle Pasta,6 to 7 servings,2-3 lbs bone-in beef short ribs english-cut Kosher salt to taste Freshly ground black pepper to taste 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 large shallot finely chopped 2 teaspoons garlic paste or minced garlic 2 celery hearts chopped 2 medium carrots chopped  1/2 teaspoon dried oregano  1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1 cup tomato sauce 1 (14.5 ounce) canned crushed tomatoes 2 cups beef stock 2 tablespoons worcestershire 1 lb tagliatelle pasta Parmigiano Reggiano cheese for topping optional   ,Generously season short ribs with salt/pepper and place them onto a plate and transfer short ribs into the refrigerator to marinate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Meanwhile on the stovetop in a large dutch oven: heat butter/oil over medium-high heat. Sear short ribs on all sides until a nicely browned crust appears about 3-5 minutes on all sides. Depending on the size of your ribs you may need to do this in batches. Once all ribs have browned transfer them to another plate and set aside. Add in shallot and garlic and let saute until mixture becomes fragrant about 2-3 minutes while stirring constantly. Then add in celery and carrots and continue cooking for another 2 minutes stirring throughout. Season mixture with oregano thyme and salt/pepper to desired taste. Add short ribs back into the pot. Pour in tomato sauce crushed tomatoes with juices beef stock and worcestershire. Gently stir everything together and make sure short ribs are fully submerged under the liquid. Cover dutch oven with lid and carefully transfer into the oven to braise for at least 3 hours. Every hour be sure to check on short ribs and gently stir together for even cooking. Turn the oven off and remove braised short ribs from the pot and transfer to a large baking dish. Ribs should be super tender and may have fallen off the bone. Use two forks to shred short rib meat and discard bones and any fatty pieces on meat. Use a slotted spoon to discard (or save) celery/carrots from braising liquid in the pot.  Add shredded beef back into braising liquid taste mixture and adjust seasoning by adding more salt/pepper to taste. You can also transfer the pot back into the warm oven while you make the pasta or just set aside. Cook tagliatelle pasta according to package directions in salted water. Drain pasta and immediately add it to the pot with braised short ribs. Gently toss together to fully coat pasta in sauce.  Use tongs to serve pasta in bowls and top with freshly grated parmigiano reggiano cheese if desired and enjoy.

Iced Honey-Apple Scones with Spelt,Dorie Greenspan,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Iced Honey-Apple Scones with Spelt,12 snowball-shaped or 8 wedge-shaped scones,2 cups (272 grams) all-purpose flour ½ cup (75 grams) spelt flour 1 tablespoon baking powder ¼ teaspoon baking soda ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt 1 small tangerine 1 clementine or ½ orange ¾ stick (6 tablespoons; 3 ounces; 85 grams) cold unsalted butter cut into small chunks 1 medium apple peeled cored and finely chopped ¼ cup (60 ml) honey 1 cold large egg ¾ cup (180 ml) cold milk  For the icing ½ cup (60 grams) confectioners' sugar About 1 tablespoon milk About 1 teaspoon bee pollen for finishing (see headnote; optional)    ,These are the scones to make the instant you feel fall in the air. They've got apples honey and tangerine flavors of the season and the surprise addition of some spelt a wheat flour that speckles their interiors. Their texture is light and because they are only slightly sweet they can take a slick of icing. My choice is a simple confectioners' sugar icing brushed on when the scones come out of the oven. While the icing is still wet I sometimes sprinkle the tops with a few grains of bee pollen. The pollen is optional but its light sweetness and chewiness finish the scones nicely.  The dough for these is very sticky so sticky that you might want to make drop scones rather than patty-cake the dough it into a disk and cut wedges. It's a good option. Whatever you do don't decide that the dough needs more flour—it doesn't! All that stickiness bakes to a light airy crumb.  A word on working ahead: The dough can be made cut and frozen up to 2 months ahead—make sure to wrap the scones airtight—and then baked straight from the freezer. As soon as you start to preheat the oven place the scones on a lined baking sheet and let them stand until the oven reaches temperature. You may need to bake them a few minutes longer.  Center a rack in the oven and preheat it to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat.  Working in a large bowl whisk together both flours the baking powder baking soda and salt. Finely grate the zest of the tangerine clementine or orange into the bowl and whisk it in—hold onto the fruit. Scatter the bits of cold butter over the flour reach in and use your fingers to mash and press and mush the butter into the flour. (You can do this with a pastry cutter but it's really easier and faster to use your fingers.) Keep tossing the dry ingredients around and smushing the butter until you've broken it into flour-coated pieces as small as cornflakes and as big as peas. Add the apple to the bowl and toss until covered in flour. Pour over the honey and using a fork give the mixture a couple of turns. There's no need to be thorough now.   Whisk the egg and milk together in a small bowl squeeze in the juice from the zested citrus and stir to blend. Pour the mixture over the dry ingredients and using the fork toss turn and stir everything together until the flour is moistened. With your hands gently—and sparingly—squeeze and knead the dough just enough to pull it into a ball. It's futile (and unnecessary) to expect a smooth neat packet of dough because this dough is wet and very sticky.  Now you've got a choice: If you want to make drop scones choose an ice cream scoop—one with a capacity of ¼ cup is good as is a ¼-cup measure or a large spoon—and scoop 12 portions of dough onto the baking sheet. If you want to make wedge shaped scones turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle that's about 6½ inches across and 1 inch high (the height's more important than the diameter here). Dust the top with flour. Using a bench scraper or a chef's knife cut the dough into quarters and then cut each quarter in half so you have 8 wedges. Carefully transfer them to the baking sheet. (At this point the scones can be froze for up to 2 months; see headnote.)  Bake the scones for 18 to 20 minutes or until they're tall and golden brown on top and bottom. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack and make the icing.  To make the icing: Put the sugar in a medium bowl and add the milk a little at a time stirring with a small flexible spatula or a spoon. It's hard to give a precise measurement for the milk—just keep stirring until you get a shiny icing that falls slowly from the tip of your spatula or spoon.  Spread some icing over each scone using a silicone brush a small offset spatula or a table knife. If you'd like s

Pommes Gaufrettes,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Pommes Gaufrettes,1 serving,Large Russet potatoes (about 2 per person)  Peanut oil for frying Salt   ,A mandoline with a fluted blade is the secret to creating the irresistible waffle design.  Cut the potatoes (leave skin on) into  3/4" thick waffles on a mandoline.  Cover these in cold water until ready to use.   First Frying: The first frying is basically to cook the potatoes through. If you've ever tried to make Pommes Frites by skipping this step you know the necessity of the first frying.   First heat the oil to 320 degrees F. Drain then thoroughly dry the potatoes with paper towels. Water will break down your frying oil (as will salt). Next when the oil is hot and the potatoes are dry drop them in batches (do not over crowd). Fry for about 4-5 minutes or until they're cooked through but NOT browned. Remove and place on a paper towel lined plate. Reserve the oil. You can prepare these a few hours ahead and leave them at room temperature.  Second Frying: Heat the oil to 365-375 degrees F.

Everything Bagel Rolls,Ashley Cuoco,home/recipes/breads/yeast-breads/Everything Bagel Rolls,10 servings,Dough: 1 3/4-cups warm milk (no hotter than 120 degrees F) 1 tablespoon active dry yeast or 2 3/4 teaspoons quick-rise yeast 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 3 3/4-cups unbleached all-purpose flour plus more for sprinkling 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter melted  Filling: 3 tablespoons poppy seeds 3 tablespoons sesame seeds 3 tablespoons dried onion 3 tablespoons dried garlic 1 tablespoons course sea salt 8 oz. cream cheese at room temperature 1 bunch chives sliced thinly on bias 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest Freshly ground pepper 1 large egg yolk 1 teaspoon water 2 tablespoons unsalted butter   ,To make the dough pour  3/4-cup of the warm milk in a small bowl. Add the yeast and granulated sugar and stir to dissolve. Set the bowl aside for 8 to 10 minutes until the mixture looks foamy. If the yeast isn't foamy after 15 minutes start with a new package.   Put the flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk to blend. Make a well in the center and pour the yeasted milk into the well. Then add the remaining 1 cup warm milk and melted butter. Stir together the ingredients until you get big shaggy clumps of dough that start to stick together.   Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface. You can always add more later so don't sprinkle too much. Dump the dough clumps out of the bowl onto your work surface. Dip your hands in flour and start kneading the dough. Using the heel of both hands firmly push the top of the mound away from you. Fold the far side of the dough toward you then rotate the mound of dough a quarter turn and push again. Keep kneading until you get a smooth springy dough. It usually takes 8 to 10 minutes. To know if you have kneaded enough press your hand into the dough and remove it quickly. Your handprint should bounce back and disappear quickly. If it doesn't keep kneading.   Lightly flour your hands and the surface if the dough starts sticking. It should feel tacky like tape but not sticky and gooey. A bench scraper is handy for scraping up any bits of dough stuck to the table and to help you move the dough around.   Rub the inside of a large bowl with a thin layer of vegetable oil or coat with pan spray. Shape the dough into a ball and put it in the bowl. Lightly rub or spray the top of the dough with a little oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Set the bowl aside and let the dough rise for 45 to 60 minutes until it is twice as big.   While the bread dough finishes rising make the filling. Mix poppy seeds sesame seeds onion garlic and sea salt in a medium bowl. Stir in chives orange zest and a few good cracks of pepper. Reserve half of the seasoning mixture for sprinkling on top of finished rolls. Add cream cheese to remaining half of seasoning mixture. Crack the egg into a small bowl and beat with a fork until blended.   To roll out the dough sprinkle 3 tablespoons flour on the work surface. Turn the risen dough out of the bowl onto the floured surface and shape it into a rough rectangle. Sprinkle another tablespoon of flour on top. Starting from the edge closest to you roll gently but firmly to the edge opposite you and then back again twice. Be careful not to roll the pin off the edge of the dough or the dough will stick to the surface. Turn the dough a quarter turn and roll up and back again twice. When you turn the dough it should move easily. If it doesn't gently lift the area of stuck dough loosening it with the small metal spatula and sprinkle some more flour underneath. Repeat the rolling up and back and turning of the dough until you have a 15 by 12-inch rectangle.   Brush any excess flour from the top and bottom of the dough with the large brush and clean up any extra flour from around the dough with the bench scraper. Position the rectangle so you are facing a long side. Mix the egg yolk with the water and then using a small pastry brush brush a thin coating of the egg mixture all over the top of the dough. (You won't need all of it.) Use your fingers to scrape the filling onto the dough and spread it evenly over the surface leaving a 1-inchwide border uncovered along the long side opposite you. Starting at the long side closest to you roll up the dough into a log keeping it fairly tight as you go. When you reach the opposite side roll the dough right on top of the uncovered border. Roll the log backward so the seam is on top and pinch all along the seam to seal it.   Lightly butter a 10 by 2-inch cake pan or spray with pan spray. Using a serrated knife cut th

Pork and Hominy Stew,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/soups-stews/stews/Pork and Hominy Stew,6 servings,3 pounds boneless pork shoulder trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks Kosher salt and ground black pepper 1 tablespoon grapeseed or other neutral oil 1 large yellow onion chopped (2 cups)  3 jalapeno chilies stemmed seeded and sliced into thin rings divided 8 garlic cloves minced 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 (29-ounce) can white hominy drained and rinsed 1 cup minced fresh cilantro  3/4 cup fresh lime juice plus lime wedges to serve   , Hominy is a type of corn kernel that has been dried and soaked in an alkali. Once rehydrated-as is the canned hominy we use in this recipe-the kernels become plump and pleasantly chewy with an earthy nutty flavor. Feel free to substitute canned pinto or pink beans if you're not a fan of hominy. Be sure to trim as much fat as possible from the pork to prevent a greasy stew. Start timing the stew once it has reached high pressure.  Don't forget to drain the hominy before using adding it to the stew.  Use paper towels to pat the pork dry then season it with salt and pepper. In a 5 1/2-liter or larger pressure cooker heat the oil over medium-high until shimmering. Add the onion and  1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook stirring occasionally until golden brown about 5 minutes. Stir half of the jalapenos the garlic and cumin; cook until fragrant about 30 seconds.  Stir in the broth and hominy then stir in the pork. Lock the lid in place and bring to high pressure (second red line) over medium-high. Adjust the heat to low to stabilize pressure at the second red line. Cook for 25 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat and allow the pressure to reduce naturally for 20 minutes then quick release the remaining pressure. Carefully open the lid and tilt it away from you to release the residual steam. Check the pork; it should be fork-tender. If not lock the lid in place return to high pressure and cook for 5 more minutes. Let the stew sit for 10 minutes then stir in the cilantro and lime juice. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve with the remaining jalapenos.

Cedar-Plank Salmon with Lemon-Dill Hollandaise,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Cedar-Plank Salmon with Lemon-Dill Hollandaise,4 servings, 3/4 cup dry white wine  3/4 cup white wine vinegar 1 medium shallot minced 1 teaspoon peppercorns 4 egg yolks 1- 1/2 cups melted unsalted butter 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon minced dill  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (5-ounce) salmon fillets skin-on and pin-bones removed 1 tablespoon minced tarragon 1 tablespoon olive oil   ,Cedar wood imparts the salmon with a lush smoky flavor. When cooking with planks they need to be immersed in water at least an hour prior to grilling. A water-soaked plank produces maximum smoke flavor and is more resistant to charring on the grill.   To make the lemon-dill hollandaise: In a small saucepan cook white wine vinegar shallots and peppercorns until nearly dry. Cool the reduction to room temperature then strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium stainless steel bowl-you should have about a tablespoon of liquid.    In a medium saucepan simmer two inches of water. Once the hollandaise reduction has cooled whisk in the egg yolks and place bowl over the simmering water; whisk constantly until thickened and warm. To avoid overcooking the mixture be sure that the water is just barely simmering with no visible signs of surface action just steam rising.  As the egg yolks warm they increase in volume.  If they become too warm and begin to coagulate around the sides and bottom remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.  When the yolks have tripled in volume and the mixture thickly coats the back of a spoon remove the bowl from the simmering water.  Stabilize the bowl by setting on a towel or on a towel inside of another bowl.  Add the butter in a slow thin stream whisking constantly until incorporated. The sauce will thicken as more butter is added.    If the sauce does start to break try adding a small amount of water and whisking until the sauce is smooth before adding more butter.  If that doesn't work try cooking another egg yolk over simmering water until thickened then adding the broken hollandaise gradually into the new egg yolk.  Stir in lemon juice and dill taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve sauce immediately or hold sauce at a temperature of 145-degrees for up to two hours.  To heat cedar planks: Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium. Close grill lid and preheat to 375 degrees F. Alternatively preheat an oven to 375 degrees and place a rack in the center.  Remove the soaked cedar plank from the water and place on the grill rack. Close the grill and allow the board to heat for a few minutes until it begins to smoke or crackle. If using a plank for the first time season the plank by placing it on a preheated grill for 2 minutes turning once. Lightly toasting the plank on both sides will intensify its smoky flavor and prevent warping. When the plank starts crackling it's ready for cooking.  To cook salmon: Using tongs arrange the salmon evenly on cedar planks. Using a silicone pastry brush lightly coat the salmon with olive and sprinkle with tarragon. Cover the grill or close the oven and cook until the fish flakes about 8 minutes.  To serve: Transfer salmon to warmed dinner plates top with a teaspoon of lemon-dill hollandaise and serve immediately.

Chocolate and Salted-Caramel Cream Puffs,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Chocolate and Salted-Caramel Cream Puffs,20 cream puffs, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1/8 teaspoon salt  1/2 cup whole milk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 or 3 large whole eggs    4- 1/2 cups sugar 2/3 cup water 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter at room temperature 1- 1/2 cups cream cheese at room temperature cut into small pieces  1/2-cup heavy cream Icing sugar for dusting   ,The two recipes below contain a variation from standard recipes. The profiterole recipe contains cocoa powder to produce a rich chocolate flavor. And instead of making a pastry cream we are using a cream-cheese base to make a salted-caramel cream.    Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F.   To make the profiteroles: In a small bowl sift the flour cocoa and 1/8 teaspoon salt. In a medium saucepan bring milk butter and granulated sugar to a boil stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the flour mixture using a wooden spoon. Return the saucepan to a medium heat; cook stirring constantly until the dough forms and the mixture is pulling away from the sides of the saucepan about 2- 1/2 minutes.   Transfer the dough to a bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium speed until slightly cooled about 2 minutes. Beat in 2 eggs 1 at a time. Test dough by touching it with your finger and lifting to form a string. If the string does not form the batter needs more eggs. In a small bowl lightly beat remaining egg and add to dough 1 teaspoon at a time testing after each addition. Beat until batter is smooth and glossy about 2 minutes.   Using a pastry bag fitted with a  1/2-inch round tip pipe about 20 1- 1/2-inch rounds of batter onto a parchment-lined baking sheet spacing about 1 inch apart. Bake until puffed and cooked through about 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool completely.  To make the salted-caramel cream: Put the sugar and 2/3 cup water in a heavy medium saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat stirring occasionally until the sugar has dissolved. Continue to cook without stirring until the syrup comes to a boil washing down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent crystals from forming. Let boil swirling the pan occasionally until the mixture turns a medium amber color. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly until warm.   In a stand mixer whisk together the butter and cream cheese. When mixture is well combined add the cream. Continue to beat until thoroughly mixed and smooth.

Also keep the oven door closed while the souffle is baking so it has a constant temperature in which to complete its rise. Rather than opening the door turn on the oven light to watch the magic.   Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Butter 4 (6-ounce) ramekins and dust with 2 tablespoons of the grated gruyere.   Place 1 tablespoon of butter in a small saucepan and place on the stove over medium heat. Add the peas and cook until soft about 2 minutes.

Tuscan Kale with Pine Nuts and Golden Raisins,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Tuscan Kale with Pine Nuts and Golden Raisins,4 servings,2 tablespoons golden raisins  3/4 cup hot water 1 1/2pounds Tuscan kale 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 3 large cloves garlic minced 2 tablespoons pine nuts toasted Kosher or sea salt   ,The crinkly-leaved greens known as Tuscan kale (or lacinato kale) get a Sicilian treatment here. The pairing of pine nuts and raisins is so commonplace in Sicily that the two are sold already mixed together. You can prepare Swiss chard turnip greens broccoli rabe or spinach by the same method. If you prefer substitute dried currants or finely diced dried apricots for the golden raisins or slivered almonds for the pine nuts. Serve with roast chicken pork or sausages.  Put the raisins in a small bowl add the hot water and soften for 20 minutes. Drain.  Fill a sink with cold water. To remove the ribs from the kale leaves easily hold each leaf upside down over the sink and with a chef's knife slice downward along each side of the rib allowing the leafy greens to fall into the sink. Discard the tough ribs. Swish the greens in the water to dislodge any dirt then lift them into a sieve or colander to drain.  Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the kale and cook until tender about 5 minutes. Drain in a sieve or colander and immediately run under cold running water until cool. Drain again and squeeze to remove excess water. Chop coarsely.  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the garlic and saute  until fragrant and lightly colored about 1 minute. Add the kale pine nuts and raisins and season with salt. Cook stirring until all the ingredients are well mixed and the kale is evenly coated with oil and hot throughout. Serve immediately.

Scones with Strawberries and Cream,Recipe Developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/breakfast/doughnuts-muffins-more/Scones with Strawberries and Cream,24 (2 1/2-inch) scones,3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour plus more for rolling out the scones  2/3 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 4 ounces (1 stick) of softened butter cut into  1/2-inch cubes 1 cup whole milk 2 eggs 3 tablespoons coarse sugar crystals or demerara sugar   2 cups sliced strawberries  1 recipe Devonshire cream   , We usually think of scones as triangle shaped from forming the dough into a circle and cutting it like a pizza. This method uses a biscuit cutter-more appropriate for high society.   Preheat oven to 500 degrees F and position rack in the upper portion of the oven. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with silpats or parchment paper.  In your food processor combine the flour sugar baking powder and salt and pulse to combine. Add butter and pulse until butter is incorporated and the mixture resembles sand. Transfer the flour and butter mixture to a mixing bowl.  In small bowl whisk milk and eggs. Set aside 2 tablespoons and add the remaining milk and egg mixture to the flour mixture stirring with a rubber spatula until just incorporated. The dough will be wet and sticky.   Heavily flour your work surface and your hands. Turn the dough out onto the floured surface and knead just until the dough is no longer sticky. Dust with flour and roll the dough into a 1-inch thick circle. Use a floured 2 1/2-inch round cutter to cut out scones.  Gather dough scraps and press together continue to cut out scones until all the dough is used.  (If you are making scones ahead simply chill them on the baking sheet until ready to bake.) Once scones are arranged on baking sheets brush with the reserved milk and egg mixture. Sprinkle with coarse sugar.  Place the scones in the preheated oven reduce the oven temperature to 425 degrees F and bake for 10 minutes until scones are golden brown. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.    
Zucchini Bread,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Zucchini Bread,1 (9-inch) loaf,2-1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt  1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg  3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 large eggs 1 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup vegetable oil 2 medium zucchini finely shredded 1 tablespoon vanilla paste 1 cup sour cream   ,Zucchini is a variety of vegetable marrow or summer squash and is derived from the Italian word zucca for squash. They are tender and tasty when young but most varieties are tasteless when large and overgrown. Zucchini is a versatile summertime vegetable that is perfect as a snack vegetable dish or as a dessert treat. The most flavorful zucchinis are small to medium-sized; the flowers of the plant are edible and contain more potassium than bananas.   Preheat an oven to 350 degrees and position an oven rack in the center. Grease a 9-inch baking loaf with vegetable spray.   In a large mixing bowl use a whisk to combine the flour baking soda baking powder salt and spices.    In a medium bowl use a whisk to combine the eggs with the sugar oil zucchini and vanilla. Using a silicone spatula fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture until just incorporated. Stir in the sour cream.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until an inserted cake tester in the center comes out clean about 45 to 60 minutes. If the loaf browns too quickly cover loosely with aluminum foil.  Transfer the tin to a cooling rack to cool slightly about 10 minutes. To remove from the tin run a knife around the edge and flip onto a board or plate. Allow to cool at room temperature before serving.

Pineapple Kumquat and Ginger Crisp with Coconut Topping,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/crisps-crumbles/Pineapple Kumquat and Ginger Crisp with Coconut Topping,6 to 8 servings, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (3 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 1 cup (3 1/2 ounces) gently packed sweetened flaked coconut  1/3 cup (1 1/2 ounces) chopped unsalted macadamia nuts  3/4 cup (2 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar Pinch of salt 1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter cut into  1/2-inch pieces  Filling: 1 medium (about 3 1/2 pounds) ripe pineapple 15 kumquats (about 4 ounces)  3/4 cup (1 ounce) finely chopped candied ginger 3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) granulated sugar 2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour  Coconut or vanilla ice cream for serving   ,If you haven't considered tropical fruit in a crisp you've got to try this combination of warm sweet pineapple paired with tart kumquats and spicy ginger all under a crunchy coconut topping. It's perfect for winter and early spring when tropical fruits and citrus are at their best and we crave big bold flavors. And the apricot variation that follows is luscious on a hot summer night. The brilliant yellow and orange filling looks like sunshine spilling onto the plate. Think wide sandy beaches a hammock between two palm trees the soothing crash of the surf...  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center.  Make the topping: Place the flour coconut nuts brown sugar granulated sugar and salt in the bowl of the stand mixer and blend on low speed for 10 or 15 seconds. Add the cold butter pieces and continue to blend on low for 3 to 4 minutes until the butter is cut into small pieces about the size of peas.  Make the filling: Use a chef's knife to slice the ends off the pineapple so it stands solidly on your cutting board. Remove the skin by slicing just under it from top to bottom. Remove any remaining “eyes&rdquo; with the tip of your knife. Use a pineapple slicer to core the pineapple and quarter it lengthwise. Alternatively use the chef's knife to slice the pineapple into quarters lengthwise and make an angled lengthwise cut along each quarter to remove the core. Cut each quarter lengthwise in half or thirds depending on the size of the pineapple then crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Transfer to the large bowl.  Rub off and discard the tiny hard stem piece on the end of each kumquat (some may not have this). Use a paring knife to cut each fruit in half crosswise then use the tip of your knife to pick out any seeds. Cut each half in two then add to the bowl with the pineapple.  Chop the candied ginger if necessary into rice-size pieces (you can leave them larger if you like big chunks). Add the ginger granulated sugar and flour to the fruit and toss well with the spatula. Scrape into the baking dish and spread in an even layer. Sprinkle the topping in an even layer over the fruit.  Bake and serve the crisp: You may want to place a baking sheet or a piece of foil under the crisp to catch any juices that may bubble over. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes until the topping is golden brown and the fruit juices are bubbling and thickened. Serve warm or at room temperature with coconut or vanilla ice cream.  Storing: Keep any leftovers in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 2 to 3 days. Reheat covered loosely with foil in a 350 degrees F oven for 10 to 15 minutes until warmed through.

Frittata with Zucchini Cherry Tomatoes and Goat Cheese,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/breakfast/egg-dishes/Frittata with Zucchini Cherry Tomatoes and Goat Cheese,2 to 3 servings,2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 zucchini about 5 ounces ends trimmed and cut into  1/3-inch-thick slices 6 large eggs beaten 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher or sea salt Freshly ground black pepper 10 cherry tomatoes halved 2 large fresh basil leaves torn into smaller pieces 1 1/2 ounces fresh goat cheese   ,You can use this recipe as a template to make frittatas with whatever your local farmers provide such as cauliflower sweet peppers leeks artichokes Swiss chard or fennel. Cook the vegetable first then incorporate with the beaten eggs and seasonings. Replace the goat cheese with grated Parmigiano Reggiano or pecorino cheese if you like. Frittatas are cooked slowly not rapidly like an omelet and they taste better when they have cooled a bit. In fact any leftover frittata-cold or at room temperature-makes a delicious sandwich tucked between two slices of toast.  Preheat a broiler and position a rack 8 to 10 inches from the element.  Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 10-inch nonstick broilerproof skillet over moderately high heat. When the oil begins to ripple add the zucchini. The slices should fit in a single layer. Cook turning once until browned on both sides. Using tongs transfer the slices to paper towels to drain and cool. Discard the oil remaining in the skillet and wipe the skillet dry with a paper towel.  Return the skillet to moderately low heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Whisk the eggs with the salt and pepper in a bowl then stir in the sautŽed zucchini. Add to the hot skillet and use a heatproof rubber spatula or fork to separate the zucchini slices so that they are evenly spaced. Cook slowly until the frittata is mostly set but still a little runny on top 8 to 10 minutes. Scatter the cherry tomatoes and basil over the surface poking them down into the moist egg. Dot with pinches of the goat cheese.  Put the skillet under the broiler element until the top is puffed firm to the touch and golden brown 2 to 3 minutes. Slide the frittata out onto a cutting board or serving platter. Let rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting into wedges. The frittata is best when warm not hot.

Chocolate Chip Chickpea Blondies,Samah Dada,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Chocolate Chip Chickpea Blondies, 12,Coconut oil for the cake pan (optional)  1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas  1/3 cup creamy almond butter (best at room temperature)   3/4 cup maple syrup  1/2 cup coconut sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 5 tablespoons almond flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  3/4 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 cup chocolate chips plus more for pressing on top    ,I know what you're thinking. How could you what would possess you to put chickpeas in a dessert?  Isn't that a little sacrilegious?  While I'm sure some would say that yes don't you dare please confine chickpeas to hummus the problem is that I can't unmake these chickpea blondies and therefore unlearn how good they are. I know too much now.   The sketchy but mostly great thing about this recipe is that you would have no idea that there were chickpeas in it. I've accidentally tricked many people in my day because the truth is the chickpeas just end up adding to the texture making it seem like you're biting into soft chewy cookie dough. The only trouble I think you might run into is getting all of the batter from the processor to your pan without tasting it. I have failed pretty much every time.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease an 8-inch square cake pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper.   Drain the can of chickpeas and rinse them well under cold water for 1 minute. Make sure they are thoroughly rinsed!    Place the rinsed chickpeas almond butter maple syrup coconut sugar vanilla almond flour salt baking powder and baking soda in a food processor or high-speed blender. Process or blend on high speed until the batter is completely smooth. Scrape down the sides of the blender or processor to get it fully incorporated if needed.   Turn off your processor or blender and pour in the chocolate chips gently folding them into the batter. I always recommend using your soul rather than a measuring cup to determine how many to use.  Transfer the batter to the prepared cake pan spreading it out evenly. Press additional chocolate chips on top of the batter—because obviously.   Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until the edges are golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake as this will dry the blondies out. It should have a slightly underbaked texture—that's how they are supposed to be!   Let cool in the pan for at least 25 minutes before slicing and serving as they will firm up after they've cooled down.   Recipe from DADA EATS LOVE TO COOK IT.

Frozen pearl onions will work in this recipe; however fresh will have better texture and flavor. Peeling pearl onions is easier after a short blanch.  Instant Pot Directions  Set Instant Pot to Saute and add oil. When oil is shimmering add bacon and saute bacon pieces until lightly browned about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to a medium bowl and reserve bacon fat in the pan.    Dry the beef thoroughly with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan add the beef to the Instant Pot and sear turning as needed until browned on all sides. Transfer seared beef to bowl with bacon. Reduce heat setting to low and add the carrot and onion to the pan; saute until lightly browned about 8 minutes.   Return the beef and vegetables; season lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over and toss to lightly coat. Slowly stir in wine and add enough broth to just cover the meat. Stir in tomato paste garlic thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Lock the lid and select High Pressure setting the timer for 40 minutes.   While the beef is cooking blanch the pearl onions in rapidly boiling salted water until tender about 4 minutes. Drain and let cool. Trim ends and peel; set aside.  To a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat add butter. When butter is melted and foaming subsides add pearl onions and mushrooms and stir to coat vegetables with the melted butter. Drizzle with sherry vinegar and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook stirring often until the vegetables are tender and have developed caramelization about 8 minutes.  When the timer on Instant Pot goes off release the pressure and check the meat. If meat is not tender cook for additional 5 minutes or so. Remove the meat and vegetables to a bowl discard thyme and bay leaves. Select Saute setting on Instant Pot and reduce the braising liquid skimming off the fat. Add the sauteed onions and mushrooms. Continue simmering until the liquid reduces into a sauce and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Return beef and vegetables and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   To serve: Just before serving stir in parsley taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and ladle into shallow soup bowls.

Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/breakfast/egg-dishes/Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise,4 servings,For the benedict: 8 large eggs 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar 4 English muffins split 16 slices smoked salmon 2 tablespoons minced chives  For the Hollandaise sauce:    1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter  3 large egg yolks 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice plus more to taste Pinch of cayenne Sea salt   ,Here is a restaurant trick to make poached eggs in advance. Simply poach your eggs just until the whites are barely set and place directly into an ice bath to stop the cooking process. When you're ready to use the eggs warm them though in a simmering pot of water for about a minute and they're ready to serve.  Eggs can be poached and chilled up to 2 days before serving.  For the benedict: Fill a medium bowl halfway with warm water. Fill a 4 quart saucepan halfway with water stir in white vinegar and bring to a gentle simmer. Break each egg into a small dish. Slide one egg into saucepan and immediately push the white around the yolk with a slotted spoon to form an oval shape. Poach egg for 2 minutes for runny yolks or 3 to 4 minutes for firm yolks. Immediately transfer poached egg to bowl with warm water. Repeat with remaining eggs. (Multiple eggs can be poached at the same time however for more perfect eggs poaching 1 to 2 eggs at a time is recommended.) To serve lift eggs from the warm water with a slotted spoon one egg at a time and dab the back of the spoon onto a double layer of paper towels to drain off the excess water trim any rough edges if desired.  To prepare Hollandaise sauce: Melt the butter in a small saucepan until very hot. Combine the egg yolks lemon juice and cayenne in the base of a blender. Blend the egg yolk mixture until it lightens in color about 30 seconds. With the blender running slowly pour in the hot butter until the sauce is creamy. If the sauce is too thick thin with a little water or additional lemon juice. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt.  To assemble benedict: Split the English muffins and divide between 4 plates top each English muffin with 2 slices smoked salmon and then a poached egg spoon hollandaise over each egg and garnish with minced chives. Serve immediately.    
Sweet-and-Spicy Ginger Green Beans,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/side-dishes/vegetables/Sweet-and-Spicy Ginger Green Beans,4 servings, 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar  1 tablespoon fish sauce  1 tablespoon soy sauce 2 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil divided  1 pound green beans stemmed and halved on the bias    3/4 cup water  1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger   1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes  2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar  Ground white pepper   , We cooked these green beans in a very hot wok without moving them to develop browning and flavor then added water to steam them until tender. Drying the beans thoroughly minimized splatter and halving them on a steep bias allowed them to absorb more flavor. A final dose of vinegar added off heat prevented the beans from losing their bright green color.  Don't use an ill-fitting lid. A proper seal is key to this recipe. Have the lid ready as soon as you add water to the wok.  In a small bowl stir together the sugar fish sauce and soy sauce. Set aside.   Heat a wok over medium-high until a drop of water evaporates within 1 to 2 seconds of contact about 3 minutes. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the beans in an even layer over the bottom and up the sides of the wok. Cook without stirring until beginning to color about 3 minutes. Add the water and immediately cover the wok. Cook until the beans are bright green and barely tender about 1 minute.  Clear a space in the center of the wok then add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the clearing. Add the ginger and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Stir the sugar-fish sauce mixture to recombine then pour in a thin stream along the sides of the wok. Stir-fry until the liquid has thickened and coats the beans about 1 minute. Off  heat stir in the vinegar. Taste and season with pepper.

The bones impart a great deal of flavor to the meat while it roasts. Remove the twine and bones just before carving to make slicing and serving easy.    Preheat oven to 450 degrees F and place a rack in the center. Allow roast to sit at room temperature 1 hour before cooking.   Place a large heavy roasting pan across two burners and heat over medium-high heat. Add the beef ribs side down and sear until browned about 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully turn the roast with tongs to sear all sides about 2 to 3 minutes per side.    Remove pan from heat remove roast and place on a heatproof cutting board. Season all sides of roast liberally with salt and pepper. Place a large roasting rack inside the roasting pan. Place roast on rack and place pan in oven. Roast for 20 minutes then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Scatter onion carrot and celery pieces in bottom of roasting pan and stir carefully to coat with pan juices. Continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the meat registers 120 degrees F about 60 minutes.     Remove pan from oven and carefully transfer roast and rack to heatproof cutting board. Tent loosely with foil and allow roast to rest for at least 20 minutes. Internal temperature of the roast will rise 5 to 10 degrees  as it rests.  To make the Madeira-Mushroom Gravy: Strain pan drippings into a fine-mesh strainer pressing on solids to remove all liquid. Pour strained drippings into a fat separator and pour off degreased drippings discarding fat. Return drippings to roasting pan and place over two burners. Heat over medium-high heat and add shallots. Cook stirring constantly until softened about 4 to 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook stirring occasionally until browned about 6 to 8 minutes. Add Madeira stock and thyme stirring bottom of roasting pan with a wooden spoon to release browned bits. Cook mixture until liquid is reduced by half about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove thyme sprigs. Taste gravy and season with salt and pepper. Stir in butter if using. Transfer gravy to a medium saucepan and keep warm over low heat.  To serve:  Remove twine and bones from roast. Place roast rib side down on a cutting board with a well. Using a sharp carving knife slice into thick slices across the grain. Serve immediately with gravy on the side. 
Smoky Tomato Ketchup,Sur La Table Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/appetizers/dips-spreads-sauces-seasonings/Smoky Tomato Ketchup,3 (8-ounce) bottles of ketchup,2 tablespoons pulverized apple wood smoking chips 1 medium yellow onion cut into  1/2-inch-thick rounds 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes including the juice from the can 1 tablespoon capers drained and rinsed  1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar Juice of 1 orange strained Juice of  1/2 grapefruit strained Juice of  1/2 lemon strained  3/4 cup cider vinegar 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher or sea salt  3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   ,It's hard to believe I would make my own ketchup to give as gifts considering that I grew up in Pittsburgh PA-home of Heinz and the big "Heinz 57" sign boldly lit and dominant on the skyline. It never even occurred to me that ketchup could be homemade until I ate at Paley's Place Bistro and Bar in Portland Oregon and had chef Vitaly Paley's deliciously nuanced ketchup. He makes all his condiments from scratch including his ketchup and I was inspired to make my own. I wanted the bright fresh flavors of Vitaly's ketchup but with a smoky twist so with his advice I smoked the onions before stewing them with the tomatoes. Given in old-fashioned hinge-topped clear glass bottles these make an adorable summertime present for the host of a backyard barbecue or as part of a Father's Day gift.  Using a stovetop smoker or wok place the wood chips in two small piles in the center of the pan. If using a smoker place a drip tray covered with aluminum foil on top of the chips. If using a wok set a large sheet of aluminum foil loosely in place over the wood chips. Place a wire rack on top of the drip tray or foil. Arrange the onion slices on the wire rack. Slide the lid on the stovetop smoker or cover the wok leaving it slightly open and then place the smoker over medium heat. When the first wisp of smoke appears close the lid. Smoke the onions for 5 minutes then turn off the heat and leave the onions in the smoker or wok with the lid tightly closed for an additional 5 minutes. Remove the onions from the smoker and coarsely chop.  Puree the tomatoes in a blender on high speed until liquefied about 2 minutes. Transfer the tomatoes to a deep 6-quart saucepan or Dutch oven and reserve.  Puree the onions and capers in the blender on high speed for 1 minute. Add the sugar and continue blending on high speed until the onion mixture is smooth about 1 minute longer. Add the citrus juices vinegar salt and pepper and blend to incorporate. Transfer the onion mixture to the pot with the tomatoes and stir to combine.  Over medium heat bring the tomato and onion mixture to a simmer. Decrease the heat to maintain a low simmer and cook stirring occasionally until the sauce thickens to a ketchup consistency 50 minutes to 1 hour.  While the ketchup is simmering wash the bottles in hot soapy water and dry thoroughly. Alternatively run the bottles through the regular cycle of your dishwasher.  Using a funnel ladle the ketchup into the prepared bottles leaving  1/2-inch headspace. Wipe the rims clean and secure the lids. Label and refrigerate.  Storing: Refrigerate for up to 2 months.

Notes:*At the restaurant we love to use Bar Harbor Mussels because they're plump and sweet.  **Most mussels at the grocery store are already cleaned. Once the bristly beard is ripped off the mussel begins to die. You always want to cook fresh live mussels because they'll have the best flavor. If you aren't going to use the mussels right away ask your fishmonger for ones with the beard on. Cleaning is easy you just tear off the fuzzy part and rinse under water.

Chocolate Velvet Pound Cake,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Chocolate Velvet Pound Cake,6 to 8 servings,1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter softened (65 degrees  to 68 degrees F) 1 3/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces) sugar 1 teaspoon water at room temperature 2 teaspoons instant espresso powder such as Medaglia d'Oro 3 large eggs at room temperature 1 cup (5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 cup (2 ounces) unsifted unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder  3/4 teaspoon baking powder Pinch of salt  1/2 cup (4 ounces) buttermilk at room temperature   ,This classic cake has a deep chocolate flavor and close-grained velvety crumb. A great keeper it's nice to have on hand in the freezer for that unexpected occasion. The cake can be dressed up with a little Dark Chocolate Ganache spooned over the top and allowed to drip alluringly down the sides. Be sure to let the ganache cool to between 85 degrees  and 90 degrees  before spooning it over the cake-at that temperature it is cool enough to run in thick rivulets for a beautiful finish. For a stunning finish to a special occasion bake the cake in individual or min bundt pans glaze with chocolate ganache then add a tophat of spun sugar.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat the pan with melted butter oil or high-heat canola-oil spray and fit it with parchment paper to extend up both long sides to the top of the pan.  Cream the butter and sugar: Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer and beat on medium-high until light-almost white-in color 4 to 5 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl although you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape down the bowl with the spatula.  Add the eggs: In the small bowl stir together the water and espresso powder until smooth. Crack the eggs into the bowl and beat to blend. With the mixer running on medium add the eggs to the butter mixture about 1 tablespoon at a time allowing each addition to completely blend in before adding the next. About halfway through turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl then continue adding the eggs. Scrape down the bowl again.  Add the dry and wet ingredients alternately: With the fine-mesh strainer sift the flour cocoa powder baking powder and salt into the medium bowl and whisk to blend. With the mixer running on the lowest speed add the flour mixture and the buttermilk alternately beginning with one-third of the flour mixture and half of the buttermilk; repeat then finish with flour mixture. Scrape down the bowl and finish blending the batter by hand if necessary.  Bake the cake: Scrape the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes until firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. When cool remove from the pan peel off the parchment paper and serve.  Storing: The cake can be made several days ahead and kept at room temperature wrapped in plastic wrap. Or double-wrap it put in a resealable plastic freezer bag and freeze for up to 8 weeks.

Vanilla Creme Brulee,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Vanilla Creme Brulee,8 servings,3 cups (24 ounces) heavy whipping cream  1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) plus 5 tablespoons (2 3/4 ounces) pure cane sugar 1 vanilla bean 9 large egg yolks   ,This is it the ultimate in sweet creamy richness topped with a crisp crust of caramelized sugar. You'll surprise everyone by serving one of the most popular restaurant desserts ever and no one needs to know how simple it is. The vanilla bean gives every bite a round deep vanilla flavor as well as an unmistakable underpinning of spicy floral notes. You can substitute other flavorings-orange or lemon zest coffee beans spices or a combination of these-to create a personalized creme brûlee. For a less rich yet still delicious version substitute whole milk for half of the cream. If you don't have a propane or butane torch for caramelizing the tops for an alternative method.  Make and flavor the custard: Place the cream and  1/2 cup of the sugar in the medium saucepan. Use the tip of a paring knife to split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Turn the knife over and use the dull side to scrape out the seeds and add both the seeds and the pod to the saucepan. Whisk well to break up the clumps of vanilla seeds. Cook over medium-low heat stirring several times to dissolve the sugar just until the mixture begins to simmer. Remove the pan from the heat cover and let steep for 30 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center.  Temper the eggs: Reheat the mixture over medium heat uncovered until it begins to simmer. In the medium bowl whisk the egg yolks. Twist a damp kitchen towel into a rope and wrap it around the bottom of the bowl to secure it while you temper the eggs. Pour about  1/2cup of the hot milk mixture into the eggs whisking constantly. Once blended whisk in another  1/2 cup. Then slowly pour the rest of the mixture into the eggs whisking constantly.  Strain and bake the custard: Pour the mixture through the strainer into the pitcher. Reserve the vanilla pod (rinse it under water and let it dry then save it for use in vanilla sugar). Place the custard cups in the large roasting pan making sure they don't touch and divide the warm custard among them. Pull out the oven rack and place the pan on the rack. Remove one of the cups pour enough hot tap water (not boiling) into that area to come halfway up the sides of the cups and replace the cup. Cut a piece of foil large enough to fit just inside the edges of the roasting pan then lay the foil across the top of the cups making sure it doesn't touch the custard. You may need to smooth and flatten the foil on the counter if any wrinkles touch the custard. Gently push the rack back into the oven shut the oven door and bake the custards for 35 to 50 minutes until edges of the custards are almost set—there should still be a small liquid area in the very center of the custard about the size of a dime (test by gently tapping the side of the pan).  Remove the foil and then the pan from the oven being careful not to tilt the pan and splash water on top of the custards. Set the pan on a heatproof surface. Use the tongs (or your hand protected by a kitchen towel) to immediately remove the cups from the water bath and place them on a rack to cool to room temperature about 40 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold at least 4 hours or overnight.  Caramelize the custards: Sprinkle the surface of each cold custard with 2 teaspoons of the remaining sugar (use a tablespoon for large shallow creme brûlee dishes). Shake the cup gently to distribute the sugar evenly-make sure it covers the custard all the way to the edge (any exposed custard will blacken immediately under the torch's flame). Set the sugared custards on a flameproof surface such as a metal baking sheet. Caramelize one custard at a time: Light the torch and with the tip of the flame just touching the surface move the flame over the sugar in a gentle circular motion until most of the sugar is melted and looks like tiny water droplets. Continue to heat using the sa

Classic Eggs Benedict with Asparagus,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/breakfast/egg-dishes/Classic Eggs Benedict with Asparagus,4 servings of 2 muffin halves,4 English muffins; split Melted butter for coating muffins (optional)  8 slices Canadian bacon  24 asparagus spears tough ends trimmed 8 large eggs 2 tablespoons white vinegar Cayenne pepper for dusting  Hollandaise Sauce:  3/4 cup dry white wine  3/4 cup white vinegar 1 medium shallot minced 1 teaspoon peppercorns 4 egg yolks 1 1/2 cups melted unsalted butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper   ,This deliciously simple brunch classic has bright green asparagus for a spring twist!  To prepare hollandaise sauce: In a medium saute pan cook white wine vinegar shallots and peppercorns until nearly dry. Cool the reduction to room temperature then strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium stainless steel bowl-you should have about a tablespoon of liquid.    In a medium saucepan simmer two inches of water. Once the reduction has cooled whisk in the egg yolks and place bowl over the simmering water whisking constantly until thickened and warm. To avoid overcooking the mixture be sure that the water is just barely simmering with no visible signs of surface action just steam rising.  As the egg yolks warm they increase in volume.  If they become too warm and begin to coagulate around the sides and bottom remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.  When the yolks have tripled in volume and the mixture thickly coats the back of a spoon remove the bowl from the simmering water.  Stabilize the bowl by setting on a towel or on a towel inside of another bowl.  Add the butter in a slow thin stream whisking constantly as it is incorporated. The sauce will begin to thicken as more butter is added.  If too thick add a little water or lemon juice.  If the sauce does start to break try adding a small amount of water and whisking until the sauce is smooth before adding more butter.  If that doesn't work try cooking another egg yolk over simmering water until thickened then adding the broken hollandaise gradually into the new egg yolk.  Serve sauce immediately or hold sauce at a temperature of 145 degrees for up to two hours.  To prepare bacon: Place a medium nonstick skillet on the stove over a moderate heat.

Classic Brioche,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Classic Brioche,ividual 6 mini loaves or 1 large loaf,2- 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour divided 1- 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast  3/4 cup cool water 4 large eggs 2 tablespoons granulated sugar  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter softened  1/3 cup poppy seeds divided  Egg wash: 1 large egg 1 tablespoon water   ,Place 1- 1/2 cups of the flour the yeast water and eggs into the bowl of a mixer or the bucket of your bread machine. Beat at medium speed (or knead in the bread machine) until smooth. Cover the mixture and let it sit for 45 minutes.   After 45 minutes the sponge will have developed some bubbles but will not have risen much because the mixture is thin. The yeast is getting a jump start.  Add the remaining 1- 3/4 cups flour the sugar and salt.   Beat for 8 to 10 minutes (switch to a dough hook if you're using a mixer) or knead in the bread machine until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and becomes shiny and elastic.   With the mixer or bread machine running add  3/4 cups poppy seeds and the soft butter 2 tablespoons at a time letting the butter become absorbed before adding the next chunk. Repeat until all of the butter is added. Cover the dough and let it rise for 1 hour. It'll be very soft at this point and should have grown by about a third. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently fold it over several times (use a bench knife to scrape up any bits that stick to the table). Place the dough into a greased bowl cover the bowl and refrigerate it for a minimum of 4 hours and up to about 16 hours. The dough will firm up considerably.  To make large brioche remove the dough from the refrigerator take a piece of the dough the size of a golf ball and set it aside. Form the rest into a round loaf. Grease a brioche pan and place the loaf into it. Take a small bowl and grease the inside and the outside of it; place this little bowl on the top of the dough and shape the reserved small piece of dough into a ball. Put this ball inside the bowl and allow the dough to rise for 1 to 1- 1/2 hours until it's an inch above the edge of the pan and looks puffy.   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and position an oven rack in the center.   Once the dough has risen remove the small bowl and gently replace the topknot. Whisk together the egg and water and brush the bread with the egg glaze and sprinkle remaining poppyseeds over top. Bake for 40 minutes until the center of the bread test 190 degrees when measured with an instant-read thermometer. Check the bread after 20 minutes: if it's browning too quickly tent the top with aluminum foil. Traditional brioche is very deep golden brown as the photo illustrates but if you want a lighter crust the foil tent will do the trick. Remove the bread from the oven and cool on a rack for 10 minutes before loosening the edge of the bread from the pan and tipping it out. Place the bread on a rack to finish cooling completely before slicing.  To make individual brioche: Divide the dough into 12 pieces. Take a marble sized piece of dough from each of the 12 pieces and set it aside. Roll each larger bit of dough into a ball; place them in greased brioche tins muffin tins or paper pans. Roll the small pieces into balls. Set them aside and let them rise with the small brioche for 45 minutes to 1 hour.    To make mini loaves (2- 1/2 x 4 inches): Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces.  Roll each piece of dough into a log shape; place them into a greased mini loaf pan and let rise for 45 minutes to an hour.  To bake individual and mini loaves:  When the dough has risen and is puffy-looking preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease your finger and poke a "belly button" into the center of each individual brioche. Gently place the small marble of dough's into these dents then brush the tops with egg wash. Bake the brioche for 25 to 30 minutes until the centers test 190 degrees when measured with an instant-read thermometer. Remove the brioche from the oven and cool on a rack before serving.

Chile-Glazed Baby Back Ribs,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Chile-Glazed Baby Back Ribs,about 6 servings,For the ribs: 1 tablespoon sea salt 3 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 tablespoon dry mustard 1 tablespoon paprika 1 tablespoon chile powder 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 racks baby back pork ribs (about 4 pounds)   For the glaze:  1 large shallot roughly chopped  2 large garlic cloves roughly chopped  3/4 cup apple cider vinegar 3 chipotle chiles in adobo plus 1 tablespoon sauce or more based on spice preference (use caution as the chiles are very spicy)  1 cup honey  2 teaspoons sea salt  1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   ,Pork ribs are often slow-cooked on a grill or in a smoker but knowing how impractical that can be for a home cook this recipe offers a simpler approach that delivers tender flavor-packed ribs that don't require constant tending. First the ribs are fully cooked in the oven until tender and then the ribs are brushed with a spicy honey glaze and finished quickly on the grill.   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.   For the ribs: Combine the spices together in a small bowl. Remove the silver skin from the underside of the ribs by sliding your fingers under the thin membrane and pulling it off. Repeat with the second rack. Rub the ribs with the seasoning on both sides. Place in a single layer in a large roasting pan and cover tightly with foil. Place the roasting pan into the oven and bake until the ribs are tender about 1 1/2 hours.  For the sauce: In the bowl of a food processor add all the glaze ingredients and puree. Transfer mixture to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook glaze uncovered stirring occasionally until sauce is thickened and reduced to a syrupy consistency about 10 minutes.   For grilling: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium heat. Grill the ribs on each side for 5 minutes. Using a silicone brush baste ribs generously with glaze and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes. (The sauce goes on at the end because it contains sugar and you don't want to burn your ribs.)  To serve: Let ribs rest 5 minutes before slicing into individual ribs. Serve ribs with extra glaze on the side.

Chicken Pot Pies,GreenPan,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Chicken Pot Pies,6 servings,1 tablespoon peanut oil 3 cups sliced mushrooms 1 onion (finely chopped)  5 carrots (sliced)  4 cups chicken stock (choose low-sodium for a healthy alternative)  4 tablespoons butter  1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 pounds chicken breasts (cut into 1-inch cubes)   3/4 cup frozen peas 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 1 egg (lightly beaten)  Salt and pepper Pie crust (recipe to follow)   The Perfect Pie Crust Makes 1 (9-or 10-inch) pie shell.   1 3/4 cups (6 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes  3/4 to  1/3 cup ice water   ,The Perfect Crust: Recipe by Cindy Mushet and Sur La Table The Art & Soul of Baking (Andrews McMeel)  This recipe can be used to make both sweet and savory pies and tarts. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month. You can also save more time by making the dough in the food processor. Place the flour and cold butter in the processor bowl and pulse to cut the butter into the flour then transfer to a large mixing bowl and proceed with the recipe. Make sure to weigh your ingredients for best results.   To make the dough place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender two knives or your fingers cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring with the fork.   Gather the clumps of dough together on the work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.   Chicken Pot Pies:  Cooking and preparation time: About 40 to 50 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.   Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the mushrooms and onion and cook over medium heat stirring frequently for 7 minutes. Add the chicken cubes carrots celery and half the stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 12 minutes until the vegetables are almost tender.  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook stirring continuously for 4 minutes. Gradually beat in the remaining stock. Simmer stirring until thick. Stir in the vegetable mixture chicken peas and thyme. Simmer for another 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture among six ramekins.   Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut out 6 circles (1 inch larger than the ramekins). Place the dough circles on top of the filling and crimp the edges. Cut a small cross in the centers. Bake the ramekins in the oven for 15 minutes at 400 degrees F until golden brown.

Adjust seasoning to taste.  ,Short ribs are cooked to outstanding tenderness in tequila then topped with spicy sauce and tangy slaw by chef and restaurateur Nancy Oakes.  Tomato-Chili Sauce:  Wipe clean the dried chili peppers and remove the stems seed and veins. Toast the peppers in a medium hot oven for a minute or two until they just start to change color. Soak the toasted peppers in water for at least 30 minutes drain and reserve the soaking water. In a spice grinder add the toasted cumin and coriander seeds. Grind into a fine powder. In a blender add the soaked chiles tomatoes onion garlic oregano cumin coriander cinnamon and cilantro stems. Add about 1 cup of the reserved soaking liquid and blend add more liquid if necessary to obtain a very smooth and thick consistency. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

Spicy Stir-Fried Cumin Beef,Christopher Kimball,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Spicy Stir-Fried Cumin Beef,4 servings,1 pound sirloin tips trimmed  3 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce divided   1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper  4 teaspoons unseasoned rice vinegar  1 teaspoon white sugar  12 dried red chilies (such as arbol or japones) stemmed  1 1/2 tablespoons cumin seeds toasted  5 large garlic cloves minced 6 teaspoons grapeseed or other neutral oil divided  1 large yellow onion thinly sliced lengthwise  2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil  1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems   , Once cooking begins things move along quickly so have all ingredients prepared and a serving platter nearby. Toasted cumin seeds added both earthy flavor and crunchy texture. Breaking some of the chilies in half released the seeds giving the dish assertive spice; leave the chilies whole for a milder version. We also loved this dish made with 1 1/2 pounds of lamb leg or shoulder trimmed and thinly sliced (freeze the lamb for about 30 minutes before slicing). The chili pods are edible but we ate around them. Serve with steamed white rice.  Don't make this dish in a tight space. Toasting the chilies and searing the meat produced a fair amount of smoke and fumes. Turn your hood vent to high before beginning or open a window or two.  Cut the meat into 2-inch pieces then thinly slice each piece against the grain. In a medium bowl combine the beef 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce and the black pepper. Stir to evenly coat. Set aside at room temperature. In a small bowl combine the remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce the vinegar and sugar  Meanwhile break open about half of the chilies then transfer all of them to a wok. Toast over medium pressing the pods against the wok until fragrant and darkened in spots 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and add the cumin. In a small bowl stir together the garlic and 2 teaspoons of the oil to form a paste.  Heat a wok over medium-high until a drop of water evaporates within 1 to 2 seconds of contact about 3 minutes. Swirl 2 teaspoons of the remaining oil in the wok add the onion then stir-fry using a metal spatula until charred in spots and partially softened 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the cumin seeds and chilies.  Return the wok to high add 1 teaspoon of grapeseed oil then arrange half of the beef in a single layer on the bottom and up the sides of the wok. Cook undisturbed until deeply browned on the bottom 1 to 2 minutes. Stir scraping the bottom and sides and cook until no pink remains 60 to 90 seconds. Transfer to the bowl with the onion. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef.  In the wok over medium-high cook the garlic paste mashing the mixture until fragrant about 30 seconds. Add the beef onion chilies and cumin. Stir the soy sauce-vinegar mixture and pour in a thin stream along the sides of the wok. Stir-fry scraping up any browned bits until the liquid is thickened about 1 minute. Off heat stir in the sesame oil and cilantro.

Sally's Turkey Bone and Stuffing Dumpling Soup,Recipe courtesy of Scraps,home/recipes/soups-stews/meat-poultry/Sally's Turkey Bone and Stuffing Dumpling Soup,10 servings  Learn more about Scraps ,Soup: 1 leftover turkey carcass and bones plus 2 pounds leftover turkey meat divided 4-6 cups leftover assorted raw vegetable scraps (such peels ends and trim from onions carrots celery root vegetables and/or herbs) Up to 6 cups assorted pan scrapings from Thanksgiving dinner such as mashed potatoes stuffing green bean casserole gravy vegetables even a slice of pie!  Leftover Stuffing Dumplings: 3 cups leftover stuffing 1 egg 2 teaspoons baking powder Chopped fresh parsley for garnish  ,Make the broth: In a large stockpot add the turkey carcass raw vegetable scraps and side dish scraps. Cover with water. Bring to a boil then partially cover and simmer on low for at least 12 hours (and up to 24).   Strain the broth: Carefully strain soup through a large fine-mesh strainer or chinois into a large clean soup pot. Bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper if needed.   Shred the turkey: Meanwhile put turkey meat in the bowl of your KitchenAidreserved  Stand Mixer fitted with flat beater attachment. On Speed 2 mix turkey until just shredded about 10 seconds. Stir turkey into soup.    Make the dumplings: In the same mixing bowl on Speed 2 add stuffing eggs and baking powder. Mix until combined.   Cook the dumplings: Using a spoon drop 2" balls of dough over the surface of stew (don't worry if they aren't perfect). Cover and cook until dumplings have puffed and feel firm about 15-20 minutes. Garnish with parsley before serving.    Notes: Everything yes everything goes in this soup! It may sound crazy to simmer all those side dish scraps into your soup. The key to this soup is simmering on low heat for hours. It gives everything time to meld together and the flavors to marry.  To get extra scrappy do like Sally does and start the soup in the same stock pot used to mash your potatoes. If you have any other pans leftover from preparing the meal add a bit of water to each and scrape up the bits leftover. The dregs will add even more flavor to your soup!   Sally sometimes simmers chunks of carrots in the final strained soup. She also has been known to put cooked bowtie pasta in each bowl of soup (if you choose to do this omit the dumplings).

Madeleines with Honey-Lavender Ice Cream,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/desserts/cookies-bars-brownies/Madeleines with Honey-Lavender Ice Cream,24 to 36 madeleines,Madeleines: 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter (6 ounces)  2 tablespoons softened unsalted butter (for greasing pan)  3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 4 large eggs A pinch fine-grain sea salt  2/3 cups sugar Zest of one large lemon 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Powdered sugar A bit of extra flour for dusting baking pan Special equipment: A madeleine baking pan regular or small  Lavender Ice Cream: 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup half-and-half  2/3 cup mild honey 2 tablespoons dried edible lavender flowers 2 large eggs  1/8 teaspoon salt    ,Ethereal lemon-scented sponge cakes destined to inspire poetry from the first bite onward.  Madeleines: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Melt the 1  1/2 sticks of butter in a small pot over medium heat until it's brown and gives off a deliciously nutty aroma roughly 20 minutes. Pour the butter into a  mesh strainer covered with a paper towel making sure to remove the solids. Cool the butter to room temperature. By doing the butter first you can complete the rest of the steps while it is cooling.  While the melted butter is cooling use the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to grease the madeleine molds-get in there and make sure you get in all the ridges. Dust with flour and invert the pan tapping out any excess flour.   Tip: Cooking spray with flour may also be used to simplify this part.  Put the eggs and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Using a whisk attachment  whip on high speed until thick (approximately 3 minutes)-the eggs should double or triple in volume. Continuing to mix on high speed slowly add the sugar in a steady stream. Whip for 2 minutes or until mixture is thick and ribbony. With a spatula fold in the lemon zest and vanilla (just until mixed).  Sprinkle the flour on top of the egg batter and gently fold in. Now fold in the butter mixture only stirring enough to bring everything together.  Spoon the batter into the molds filling each mold 2/3-  3/4 full. Use a small cup filled with batter to keep things clean and manageable;  it is easier than using a spoon.  Bake the madeleines for 12-14 minutes (7-10 minutes for smaller cookies) or until the edges of the madeleines are golden brown. Remove from oven and unmold immediately. Cool on racks and dust with powdered sugar.  Lavender Ice Cream: (Special equipment: a candy or instant-read thermometer and an ice cream maker)  Bring cream half-and-half honey and lavender to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat; stirring occasionally.

Return mixture to clean saucepan and heat over moderate heat until hot.   Whisk together eggs and salt in a large bowl; Slowly add 1 cup hot cream mixture into bowl whisking while pouring. After mixed pour into remaining hot cream mixture in saucepan and cook over moderately low heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until thick enough to coat back of spoon (about 5 minutes). Temperature should register 170 to 175 degrees F on thermometer (do not boil).   Pour custard through sieve into clean bowl and cool completely stirring occasionally. Chill covered for at least 3 hours.   Freeze custard in ice cream maker. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.

Fresh Squid Ink Pasta Dough,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/grains-legumes-pasta/Fresh Squid Ink Pasta Dough,4 servings,2  1/2 cups "00" flour plus more for dusting  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 4 large eggs 2 tablespoons squid ink   ,To make dough: Place flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Pulse to combine. Add the eggs and squid ink and process for 30 to 60 seconds or until the mixture comes together into a ball. When the pasta dough is thoroughly mixed turn it out on a lightly floured work surface. Knead dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky adding small amounts of flour as needed; 2 to 3 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest for at least 20 minutes or up to an hour at room temperature.  To roll dough: Secure a pasta machine to the edge of a long countertop. Using a bench scraper cut the dough into three pieces. Keep extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with one piece. With a rolling pin roll the piece of dough into a rough rectangle so that it will fit inside the widest setting of the pasta machine. Roll the dough through the machine catching it with one hand as you roll with the other. Take the dough and trifold it like a letter. Turn the dough so one open end faces the machine and roll it through on the widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting.   Continue rolling the pasta through the machine without folding adjusting the rollers to a smaller setting each time until the desired thickness is reached. If the pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling.  Cut sheets to desired shapes and sizes toss with semolina flour and set aside covered with a clean kitchen towel. The pasta can be cooked immediately or covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use.   To cook pasta: Heat a large pot of water over high heat until boiling.

Classic Deep-Fried Turkey,Waring Pro,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Classic Deep-Fried Turkey,10 to 12 servings,1 (13 to 14 lb.) free range turkey 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon black pepper  1/2 teaspoon paprika 2 1/2 gallons of good-quality oil   ,What's good for the chicken is good for the turkey. Maybe even better. We love how rotisserie frying creates extra-crisp skin while keeping meat tender juicy and packed with incredible flavor-no basting required. Best of all you'll have more room in the oven for side dishes and pie.   This recipe was tested with the Waring Proreserved  Rotisserie Turkey Fryer and Steamer. Be sure to follow all the rotisserie use and frying directions from the owner's manual for proper operation and safety procedures.  Combine spices and generously rub over the entire turkey being sure to cover the interior cavity in addition to putting spices between the skin and breasts. This can be done by sliding your hand between the skin and the breast meat creating a pocket for the spices.  Once the turkey is seasoned and trussed let it sit covered and refrigerated for at least two hours or as long as overnight.  Allow enough time to bring the turkey to room temperature; fill the fryer with your preferred oil and heat it to 350 degrees F.   Insert rotisserie spit through center of seasoned turkey and attach securely to the rotisserie bar.  Slowly lower turkey into heated oil and fry for 3 to 3 1/2 minutes per pound. When the breast of the turkey reads 165 degrees  to 170 degrees F it is done. Note: always remove meat thermometer from turkey before resuming frying.  Carefully remove fryer basket from oil. Loosely cover turkey with aluminum foil and let it rest for at least 15 minutes before carving.  Slice serve and let the compliments begin!

Don't forget to purchase your turkey far enough in advance to account for thawing and brining times at least four days for a 12 pound frozen turkey.  For dry brining: Wash the turkey thoroughly in cold water and pat completely dry with paper towels. Place the turkey on a large cutting board and run your hand gently between the skin and meat to loosen the skin being careful not to tear the skin. Loosen as much skin as possible over the breasts legs and thighs. Rub the meat with kosher salt to coat the meat evenly again taking care not to rip the skin. Transfer the turkey to a baking dish large enough to hold it and place uncovered in the refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours.  To dress and roast turkey: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and place a rack in the lower third. Remove turkey from the refrigerator and transfer to a cutting board. Place  1/2 the melted butter in a small mixing bowl add chopped herbs and stir to combine. Rub the turkey meat with the butter mixture coating all parts equally. Gently stretch skin to cover breast meat completely. Using kitchen twine tie the legs together at the ankles and tuck wing tips under breasts.  Place a heavy roasting rack inside a large roasting pan and lightly oil the rack. Flip turkey breast side down and place on top of rack. Place turkey in oven and roast for 60 minutes turning the roasting pan every 30 minutes to ensure even browning. Check roasting pan to make sure pan drippings do not scorch adding stock or water as needed.  After 60 minutes remove roasting pan from oven and reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Using turkey lifters or clean kitchen towels carefully lift turkey off the rack breast side up. Return turkey to rack breast side up and baste with pan juices. Scatter onion carrot and celery pieces across bottom of roasting pan stirring to coat with pan juices. Return turkey to oven and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F 2 hours or more depending on weight. Remove turkey from oven place roasting pan on a heatproof surface and tent turkey loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Rest the turkey for at least 20 to 30 minutes before carving. Strain pan drippings pressing on solids to remove liquid and reserve drippings to make gravy.  To serve: Remove legs and thighs using a sharp boning knife. Slice the breasts into  3/4-inch slices and place on a serving platter with legs and thighs. Serve immediately.  Try our chef's recipe for Rich Turkey Pan Gravy:  Click for instructions »

Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients; mix just to combine then mix in egg white. Fold in chocolate and pistachios.  Divide dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into an 8" long log about 1 1/2" in diameter pushing dough together if it feels crumbly. Wrap tightly in parchment paper and chill until firm at least 4 hours. (The colder your dough the easier it will be to slice.)  Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Working with 1 log of dough at a time and using a serrated knife cut logs into  3/4"-thick rounds and transfer to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets spacing  1/2" apart.  Sprinkle cookies with sea salt and bake rotating baking sheets halfway through until set around edges and centers look dry 10-12 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool.

Lemon Mascarpone Layer Cake,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/desserts/cakes-custards/Lemon Mascarpone Layer Cake,1 cake,1 recipe Lemon Curd click here  Sponge Cakes: 6 large eggs separated 7 tablespoons plus 7 tablespoons sugar 1 3/4 cups sifted cake flour  Lemon Syrup:  1/2 cup sugar  1/2 cup water  1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice  Mascarpone Filling: 2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream 7 tablespoons sugar 1 pound mascarpone   ,This soft moist towering cloud of a dessert lies somewhere between a cake and a trifle its lemon syrup–soaked cake layers alternating with lemon mascarpone cream. Perfect for entertaining the cake is at its best the day after you assemble it when the flavors and textures have had a chance to blend and mellow. Meyer lemons are especially fragrant but this cake is outstanding with supermarket Eureka lemons as well. There are a few steps here but almost everything can be done ahead which makes putting it together pretty easy-check the notes at the end of the recipe.   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and position oven racks in the lower and upper thirds. Fit each cake pan with a parchment round. Do not grease the pans.  Make the cakes: Whip the egg yolks and 7 tablespoons of the sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer on high speed until thick and very light in color 4 to 5 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl although you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside while you whip the egg whites.  In the cleaned mixer bowl with the cleaned whisk attachment or in the cleaned medium bowl with clean beaters whip the egg whites on medium speed to soft peaks. With the mixer running gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons of sugar; continue beating until the egg whites hold firm peaks. Fold one-third of the egg whites into the beaten yolks with the spatula then use the fine-mesh strainer to sift half of the flour over the top and gently fold it in. Repeat. Fold in the last of the egg whites until no streaks of white remain.  Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes until the tops are golden firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean. Halfway through the baking time switch the pans on the racks so they bake evenly. Transfer the cakes to a rack to cool completely.  Make the lemon syrup: Heat the sugar and water in the small saucepan stirring occasionally until the sugar has completely dissolved and  Make the mascarpone filling: Place the cream and sugar in the cleaned mixer bowl and whip until soft peaks form. Place the mascarpone and 1 cup lemon curd in a large bowl and stir until blended-it should be the consistency of pudding. Gently fold in the whipped cream until the mixture is homogenous and thick. If the mixture becomes overworked it will look grainy or separated. If this happens stir in several tablespoons of cream with the spatula and stir just until the mixture has smoothed out again. Transfer 2 3/4 cups of filling to a medium bowl to use for piping decorations. Transfer half of the remaining filling to another medium bowl. Refrigerate all 3 bowls of mascarpone mixture. You may want to label the three bowls: one for piping one for filling layers and one for frosting.   Unmold the cakes: Run the thin flexible knife or spatula around the edge of a pan to loosen a cake. Turn the pan upside down and give it a sharp rap on the table to release (don't worry these cakes are very sturdy). Turn the cake right side up leaving the parchment paper attached. Repeat with the remaining cake. Level the cakes if necessary (see page 308). Using the serrated knife slice each cake horizontally into two layers (see page 308). Set aside one of the bottom layers to use last and remove the parchment from the other layer.  Assemble the cake: Place a cake layer cut side up on the cake cardboard or serving plate. Brush the cake with  3/4 of the lemon syrup. With the icing spatula spread  1/3 of the mascarpone filling on top. Place 3 level tablespoons of the remaining lemon curd on top of the filling and spread evenly to the edge.  Place a second cake layer on top cut side up and repeat with lemon syrup mascarpone filling and lemon cur

Cherry Limeade Quick Pops,Zoku,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Cherry Limeade Quick Pops,6 pops,1 cup (8 fl oz) all natural limeade 6 ounces (a heaping cup) fresh or frozen pitted sweet dark cherries Zest of a fresh lime   ,In a blender combine limeade cherries and lime zest; puree until smooth.  Insert the sticks into the Zoku Quick Pop Maker and pour the cherry-limeade base to the fill line of each cavity. Let freeze completely then remove the pops with the Super Tool. Repeat with remaining pops. If you're going for the striped look layer the cherry-limeade base with plain limeade-just be sure to allow each layer to freeze before adding the next layer. Please note that layering flavors will require a longer freezing time for each batch of Quick Pops. Please note that the mixture will be thicker when frozen cherries are used. If you find your mixture to be too thick simply thin it down with a little more limeade. The color of your Cherry Limeade Quick Pops will vary depending on the variety of cherries you use.  Tip: We recommend tasting the base before filling the Zoku Quick Pop Maker. If your cherries are nice and sweet you won't need added sugar. If you find your base needs to be sweetened up simply add in a little sugar or agave until you reach your preferred level of sweetness.

If you measure everything out the night before these can be tossed together in no time even on a weekday morning. They're a great project for kids.  Preheat the oven to 400°F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat a standard 12-cup muffin pan with melted butter oil or high-heat canola oil spray. Place the flour  2/3 cup of the sugar the baking powder baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to blend thoroughly.  In a medium skillet melt the butter with the lemon zest (this will help to bring out the flavor of the zest and distribute it evenly in the batter). Turn off the heat. Add the buttermilk and let it sit for 1 to 2 minutes just until it is tepid. Pour the liquid into a medium bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Whisk until well blended.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the liquid ingredients into the well. Mix only until there are no more streaks of flour or pools of liquid and the batter looks smooth. A few small lumps scattered throughout are fine-they will disappear during baking. Gently fold in the raspberries until evenly distributed.  Use a large ice-cream scoop or 2 soupspoons to divide the batter evenly into the prepared muffin cups. Stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and the cinnamon and sprinkle it over the tops of the muffins.  Bake the muffins for 18 to 20 minutes until the tops feel firm and a skewer inserted into the centers comes out clean. Transfer the muffin pan to a rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Gently run a knife or spatula around each muffin to free it from the pan lift the muffins out and transfer them to the rack to finish cooling (careful these are tender while hot). Serve warm or at room temperature.

Pastry Dough,Sur La Table Andrews McMeel Publishing,home/recipes/breads/dough/Pastry Dough,1 (9-inch) pie crust,1- 3/4 cups all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  1/2 cup unsalted butter cold cut into  1/2-inch cubes   ,A classic recipe that's great for savory or sweet pies from meat-filled empanadas to apple turnovers. You can make the dough ahead of time wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month. You can also save more time by making the dough in the food processor. Place the flour and cold butter in the processor bowl and pulse to cut the butter into the flour then transfer to a large mixing bowl and proceed with the recipe. Make sure to weigh your ingredients for best results.  To make the dough: Either place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl or into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. If using a mixing bowl use a pastry blender two knives or your fingers to cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring.  If using a food processor add the cut butter to the flour and pulse mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Drizzle in ice water and pulse until the flour holds together.   Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed.   Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.

In a large mixing bowl put the apples sugar salt cinnamon nutmeg allspice vinegar calvados and flour and mix lightly until most of the surfaces are covered with what looks like wet sand.  Pour the mixture into an unbaked piecrust mounding high and dot with butter.  Roll out the remaining dough lay it over the fruit and cut 5 to 6 vents on top. Trim the excess dough from the edges and crimp.  Cover the pie and chill in refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Look for steam and a slight bit of juice coming out of the vents before removing the pie from the oven. Get your ear right down almost to the top of the pie and listen for the sizzle-whump which some call the pie's heartbeat.  Cool the pie for at least an hour.

Tangerine-Champagne Sorbet,David Lebovitz,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Tangerine-Champagne Sorbet,1 quart,3 cups (750ml) freshly squeezed tangerine juice from 4 pounds (1.9kg) tangerines  2/3 cup (140g) granulated sugar 1 cup (250 ml) Champagne or sparkling wine   ,"Most people associate Christmas in Paris with luxe items specifically oysters foie gras Champagne and chocolate. But no feast is complete until the clementines come out: shiny bowls of little orange citrus often festooned with their leaves.  From the start of clementine season which begins in late fall Parisians make the rounds of the outdoor markets going from stand to stand tasting the samples that vendors peel and put on plates to find the sweetest specimens out there. Most vendors use their fingers to peel the tangerines but a few use their teeth to rip away the skin. (I avoid tasting those particular ones.) Of all the things people associate with winter in Paris-the lavish department store windows people buying Champagne by the case lugs of fresh oysters sold on the sidewalks butchers offering creamy slabs of pate de foie gras-I look forward to those clementines the most. And it's impossible not to get caught up in the fruit frenzy at the market with shoppers and vendors loading up big bags to carry home and no one leaves with less than a few pounds.  Of course my responsibility every year for Christmas is the final course and one year I made a dessert that had everyone stunned: a Champagne jelly with supremes (carefully cut sections with no membranes) of pink grapefruit tangerines navel oranges and thin strips of candied orange peel festively served in Champagne glasses with a scoop of icy-cold tangerine-Champagne sorbet perched on top. It's a wonderful do-ahead dessert that goes especially well after winter dishes like cassoulet (page 195) or Counterfeit duck confit (page 179)." -Reprinted with permission from My Paris Kitchen by David Lebovitz copyright Copywrite  2014. Published by Ten Speed Press an imprint of Random House LLC.  In a large saucepan over low heat warm  1/2 cup (125ml) of the tangerine juice with the sugar stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 1/2 cups (625ml) of tangerine juice. Add the Champagne. Transfer to a container and chill thoroughly.  Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Note that this will not freeze as hard as other sorbets because of the alcohol in the Champagne. However it will make it more scoopable once fully frozen.  Variations: If you wish to serve this with Champagne gelee soften 2 envelopes (14g) of unflavored gelatin by sprinkling over  1/2 cup (125ml) of cold water in a very large bowl and letting sit for 5 minutes. In a small saucepan heat  1/2 cup (125ml) of water with 1 cup (200g) of sugar until the sugar is dissolved then pour it over the gelatin and stir well. Add 1 bottle of Champagne or sparkling wine (it will foam up so pour it slowly) and a squeeze of lemon or lime juice. Pour the mixture into a smaller container and chill until firm at least 6 hours.  To serve spoon some of the chilled gelee in wine goblets breaking it up into bite-size mounds. Garnish with fresh orange tangerine or grapefruit segments or a combination of them. Top with a scoop of tangerine-Champagne sorbet. Duck fat cookies (page 297) make a snappy accompaniment. Tangerine-Champagne sorbet is also good with a spoonful of warm sabayon made with either Champagne or a sweet dessert wine such as Sauternes. Make the sabayon by whisking together  2/3 cup (165ml) of Sauternes with  1/3 cup (60g) of sugar and 6 large egg yolks in a large bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Continue whisking until the mixture becomes foamy. Keep whisking until it thickens; when you lift the whisk the mixture should hold its shape when it falls back onto the surface.

Fish Friture,Jacques Pepin,home/recipes/main-courses/seafood/Fish Friture, 8  Learn more about Scraps ,1 pound small minnows whitebait smelt small sunfish or other tiny fish About 6 cups corn oil for deep-frying  1/2 cup milk 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder Salt   ,A friture is a dish of deep-fried tiny fish: whitebait or other fish found in rivers or ponds are coated with flour and fried until crisp like French fries. Small freshwater minnows roach gudgeon and even very small sunfish are delectable prepared this way. I drag a net in knee-deep water along my local beach in late summer and get more of these fish than I could ever use. If you try this make sure you drag your net when the tide is coming in.  Friture is commonly served in small cafes along the little lakes and rivers in France often with aperitifs before a meal. Although some cooks fry the fish without gutting them they tend to taste bitter and the final result is well worth the work required to clean them. These tiny fish are utterly delicious and completely free an undiscovered resource.  Freshly caught fish will live for a while in a pail of water but most of the time I gut them right at the beach so I don't make a mess at home.   Prepare the fish: Using your thumb and index finger press and push down on the belly of each one starting at the head and pushing toward the tail so the guts come out. Wash the fish in cold water changing the water several times. Drain on paper towels then place in the milk to soak.  Heat the oil to about 400 degrees F. Meanwhile drain the fish and put it in a plastic bag with the flour and baking powder. Seal the bag and shake it so the fish are well coated with the mixture. (Be sure to do this at the last moment; you cannot keep the fish floured too long or the moisture in them will come out and make their outsides gummy.) Shake the fish in a colander to remove excess flour. Cook in batches dropping the fish into the hot oil and cooking for about 5 minutes until crisp and brown. Lift out of the oil and sprinkle with salt.  Arrange the fish on a platter and serve. Eat piping hot with your fingers.

Triple Citrus Sorbet,Cuisinart,home/recipes/desserts/ice-cream-yogurt-sorbets/Triple Citrus Sorbet,4 1/2 cups,2 large grapefruits (about 2 1/2 pounds)  2 oranges (about 1 1/2 pounds)  1 lime 1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup water   ,Cool and refreshing this sorbet uses citrus juice plus the zest to maximize flavor.  Peel a 4-inch piece of zest off of one grapefruit and one orange. Grate  1/2 teaspoon of zest from the lime; reserve.  Put the grapefruit and orange peel into a medium saucepan with 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water. Set over medium-low heat and cook until the sugar has fully dissolved remove from heat and cool completely. Once cool remove the citrus peels and discard.  Juice the grapefruits oranges and lime. There should be about 3 cups of juice in total. Whisk together with the lime zest and the cooled citrus simple syrup.  Assemble the paddle holder of the Cuisinartreserved  Fruit ScoopTM  Frozen Dessert Maker with the ice cream attachment. Place in freezer bowl and turn the unit on. While the unit is running pour the mixture into the frozen freezer bowl. Allow to churn until thickened about 22 to 24 minutes. The sorbet will have a soft creamy texture. If a firmer consistency is desired transfer the sorbet to an airtight container and place in freezer for about 2 hours. Remove from freezer about 15 minutes before serving.   
Black Duck with Black Trumpet Mushroom Soil Black Garlic Puree and Blackened Long Carrots,DeLille Cellars,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Black Duck with Black Trumpet Mushroom Soil Black Garlic Puree and Blackened Long Carrots,1 serving,Black Garlic Puree: 1 garlic clove (black peeled)  1 teaspoon lemongrass (tender white bulb only crushed and minced)  1 teaspoon fresh ginger (minced)  1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon grape seed oil 2 to 3 tablespoons coconut milk 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons water  Black Trumpet Mushroom Soil: 1 package of dried black trumpet mushrooms 1 teaspoon coffee flour 1 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon water   Duck Breasts: 2 duck breasts 4 twigs of thyme Salt and pepper  Blackened Long Carrots: 8 long carrots 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons butter 3 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon cumin seed Salt and pepper   ,This dish is so delicious that Jason Wilson's Crush Restaurant featured it on their menu for a month paired with our DeLille Cellars 2012 Four Flags Cabernet.  The idea is for the mushroom soil to soak up the duck juices along with the black garlic puree to produce a whole array of savory flavors.  I have felt for some time now that of all the meats and poultry duck breasts are best Sous Vide.  However if this is unavailable to you you can certainly pan sear the duck with the same seasoning on medium high heat.  To make the Black Garlic Puree: add all ingredients into a food processor or blender and puree. Set aside.  To make the Black Trumpet Mushroom Soil: put dried mushrooms coffee flour and sugar into a food processor or coffee grinder and grind. Transfer to a small bowl and add water. Stir until it has the appearance of dirt.  To make the Duck Breasts: pat the duck breasts dry and season with salt and pepper. Place a twig of fresh thyme on each breast and place in a vacuum sealed bag. Seal and Sous Vide at 135 degrees F for roughly an hour. Remove breasts and mark and sear them at 500 degrees F on a grill or a very hot pan (about 30 seconds per side). Cut each breast in half length-wise and then slice each for 4 portions.  To make the Blackened Long Carrots: while the duck is cooking in a large pan at medium-high heat saute the carrots in the oil for about 10 minutes (or when they start to soften and turn color). Add the butter cumin and honey. The carrots should start to caramelize and darken. Add salt and Pepper to taste.  To Serve: simply sprinkle the mushroom soil on 4 plates.  Place each duck breast half over the soil and zig-zag the black garlic puree on top.  Complement with the carrots on the side.

Basic Fresh Masa Preparada,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Basic Fresh Masa Preparada,about 3 dozen tamales,1  1/3 cups lard or unsalted butter at room temperature 1  1/2 teaspoons sea salt 1  1/2 teaspoons baking powder 3 pounds fresh masa (not "masa preparada" which already includes lard and flavorings) 2 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth plus more as needed   For assembling tamales:  1 bag soaked corn husks Filling of your choice    ,In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment place the butter or lard with salt and baking powder (if using) and whip on high speed until fluffy about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and add the fresh masa alternating with 2 cups of broth. Beat until well mixed. (Depending on the capacity of your mixer you may need to do this in two batches.)  Increase mixer speed to medium-high and whip until masa resembles the consistency of soft yet workable dough about 3 minutes. If the dough is too firm add more broth  3/4 cup at a time until the correct consistency is attained.   To assemble the tamales: lay the corn husk flat rough side down and the tip pointing away from you. If it's a small husk place two together overlapping them a bit. Spread about  1/3 cup masa preparada in the center of the bottom part of the husk using moistened fingers or the back of a spoon smooth dough to about a  1/3-inch thickness. Top with 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling of your choice. Fold the two long sides of the husk towards the middle so that the masa forms a tube around the filling. Fold the pointed tip of the husk down over the filled section. The filling end will be exposed but the masa will set and protect it during steaming.  To steam the tamales: Add 2 cups water and the steamer insert to the pressure cooker.  Working in batches stack tamales vertically inside the cooker with the open end up and pressure cook for 15 minutes.  If husk does not peel away easily pressure cook for 5 to 10 minutes more until tamales are cooked through.   
Beet Greens with Nutmeg and Clementine,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/salads/fruit-vegetable/Beet Greens with Nutmeg and Clementine,10 servings, 3/4 cup vegetable oil 3 cloves garlic crushed 2-inch piece ginger minced 1 fresh red chili thinly sliced 1 preserved lemon skin only finely chopped 2 clementine oranges zested and juiced divided 5 pounds beet greens (from about 8 bunches beets) chopped  1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper   ,Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic ginger and chili and cook stirring constantly until fragrant about 1 minute.  Add preserved lemon clementine zest and greens. Season with 1 teaspoon salt. In batches stir in greens covering pan to wilt between each addition.  Add nutmeg and clementine juice. Season more with salt and pepper before serving.  Tips:  Crush your ginger with the side of a knife before mincing. Keep the stems on your beet greens! They add a little crunch to the sauteed greens.  1/2 teaspoon nutmeg is about 10 gratings on a fine rasp grater. Most recipes call for naval oranges. You never end up using the entire orange. Use clementines instead-you probably already have them in your fridge.

Parmesan-Herb Popovers,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Parmesan-Herb Popovers,12 popovers,1- 3/4 cup (10 ounces) whole milk 2 large eggs 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  1/2 cup (2 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme 4 tablespoons (2 ounces) unsalted butter cut into 12 equal pieces   , Popovers are culinary sleight of hand. Their simple ingredients and mixing method belie the great heights to which they rise during baking puffing up like crispy brown balloons. All of the ingredients may be measured in advance but do not combine them until you are ready to bake the popovers. A popover pan is designed to optimize that rise with tall narrow cups that force the batter upward. You can bake popovers in a regular muffin pan although they don't rise as high and they develop a rounded depression at the bottom that when turned upside down is the perfect spot for some gravy. Popovers do not hold or store well so plan on enjoying them when they are fresh from the oven. If they have cooled reheat them briefly in a 350 degrees F oven for 5 to 10 minutes until warm.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and position a rack in the center. Once the oven is fully heated heat the popover pan in the oven for 7 minutes. In the medium bowl whisk together the milk eggs flour and salt until well blended. Add the Parmesan cheese and thyme and blend well.  Use a spatula to scrape the batter into a measuring cup. Remove the pan from the oven and close the oven door. Drop one piece of butter into each hole of the popover pan. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cups.   Return the pan to the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Turn the oven down to 400 degrees F and continue to bake for 10 minutes longer until the popovers are puffed and deep golden brown. Cool the pan on a rack for a couple of minutes. Remove popovers from the pan with a spoon or small offset spatula and serve hot.

Basic Pesto Recipe,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/cuisine/italian/Basic Pesto Recipe,1 serving,4 parts fresh basil leaves  1 part Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese  2 parts olive oil  1 part pine nuts  1 part minced fresh garlic   ,The name pesto comes from the same Latin root of "pestle" which is fitting as the sauce in its simplest form is made by crushing a few key ingredients together.    Basil has several health benefits. It interferes with the growth of bacteria it may also help with inflammation and is good for heart health.  You can either mix the ingredients in a food processor or simply crush them together with a mortar and pestle. To keep sauce fresh for as long as possible to add a layer of olive oil on top of the sauce once it has been placed in a jar. Pesto can keep in the refrigerator this way for over a week and can be kept in the freezer for up to three months.

Pour in 1 cup of additional vegetable stock and stir/cook until it has been absorbed.  Repeat 2 more times.  With the last cup stir until the rice is al dente tender but still a little chewy (and most of the liquid has been absorbed).  Stir in the mashed squash and reduce the heat to very low so that the risotto stops simmering.  Stir in the parmesan and butter to give the risotto a nice creamy finish.  To serve: spoon it immediately into heated shallow serving bowls. Sprinkle a little more Parmesan over it and shave the truffle on top. Note: truffles not pictured.

Rosemary Flank Steak with Balsamic Glazed Onions,Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Rosemary Flank Steak with Balsamic Glazed Onions,4 to 6 servings,3 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves plus whole sprigs for garnish    1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil divided   3 large cloves garlic minced    1/2 teaspoon cracked black peppercorns    1/2 cup balsamic vinegar divided   1 1/2 pounds flank steak trimmed   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste   2 medium red onions peeled and sliced into  3/4-inch thick rounds   Fresh rosemary sprigs for garnish     ,Crush the rosemary needles lightly with a rolling pin to release their volatile oil.  In a small bowl combine the rosemary with  3/4 cup of the olive oil the garlic cracked peppercorns and 2 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar.      Place the flank steak in a shallow non-reactive dish and pour the marinade over.  Turn the steak to coat both sides pressing the spices onto the steak.  Marinate for 30 minutes.      Preheat the grill to medium heat.  Clean the grill grates with a stiff brush then oil liberally to prevent sticking.  (Note: To use a grill pan preheat the pan to medium-high heat; add a very light coating of oil and heat through.)  Remove the steak from the marinade.  Brush off any garlic or spices clinging to the steak and season both sides well with salt and pepper. Place the steak on the prepared grill or grill pan and cook 2 to 3 minutes then without turning the steak over rotate it 90 degrees and place back on the grill or grill pan; this will produce beautiful brown cross-hatch grill marks.  Cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes.      Brush the top of the steak generously with balsamic vinegar.  Turn the steak over and brush the other side generously with balsamic vinegar.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes then rotate the steak 90 degrees; cook to an internal temperature of 125 degrees F for medium rare about 2 to 3 minutes or to 135 degrees F for medium approximately 4 to 5 minutes.  Transfer to a platter and tent loosely with foil.      Clean and re-oil the grill grates or grill pan.  Brush the onion slices on both sides with olive oil; season well with salt and pepper.  Grill the onions approximately 2 minutes on each side.  Brush the onions with the remaining balsamic vinegar and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.       Slice the flank steak on the bias into thin slices cutting across the grain.  Arrange the slices on a serving platter; pour over any juices that collected on the platter where the steak was held.  Place the grilled balsamic onions on the platter with the steak.  Garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs and serve immediately.  
Pork Tenderloin with Apples and Cranberries,Recipe developed for Fagor by America's TEST KITCHEN,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Pork Tenderloin with Apples and Cranberries,4 to 6 servings,2 (12 – to 16- ounce) pork tenderloins trimmed  2 teaspoons dried herbes de Provence Salt and pepper  2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour  1 cup apple cider 1- 1/2 pounds Granny Smith apples peeled cored and quartered   1/2 cup dried cranberries 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter    , Cooking lean thin pork tenderloins in a pressure cooker is tricky since they can overcook so quickly. After several tests we found that even one minute of pressurized cooking followed by a 15-minute natural release turned out tenderloins that were overcooked.   Switching to quick release gave us slightly better control over the meat's doneness but the dramatic change in pressure at the time of the release caused the meat to turn tough. In the end we discovered perfectly cooked juicy pork tenderloins required removing the pot from the heat as soon as high pressure was reached then allowing the pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes.   Pork and fruit are a natural classic combination so we included a mix of apples and cranberries in the pot. Seasoning the pork with some herbes de Provence ensured there was a savory flavor to balance the sweetness of the fruit. We cut the apples into quarters to allow them to cook to the proper doneness in the same time as the pork and it also kept the prep easy. Apple cider brown sugar and a tablespoon of butter to finish created the perfect accompanying sauce.    Total Time: About 45 minutes less than 1 minute under pressure Pressure Level: High Release: Natural   Build flavor: Pat pork dry with paper towels and season with herbes de Provence salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in pressure-cooker pot over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown tenderloins on all sides 6 to 8 minutes; transfer to plate.  Add flour and remaining 1 tablespoon oil to now-empty pot and cook over medium heat for 1 minute. Whisk in apple cider smoothing out any lumps. Stir in apples cranberries and sugar. Using wooden spoon scrape up all browned bits stuck on bottom of pot. Nestle tenderloins with any accumulated juices into pot.  High pressure then naturally release pressure:  Lock pressure cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat. As soon pot reaches high pressure remove pot from heat and allow pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes. Quick release any remaining pressure then carefully remove lid allowing steam to escape away from you.  Before serving: Transfer tenderloins to carving board tent loosely with aluminum foil and let rest while finishing sauce. This will help redistribute the meat's juices. Next bring apple mixture to gentle simmer stir in butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice pork and serve with apple mixture.  Troubleshooting:   How do I know the tenderloin is cooked through?: We've never encountered underdone pork when preparing this recipe but the center of the tenderloin should register 140 to 145 degrees F before resting. If it is underdone simmer it gently in the sauce over medium-low heat until it registers 140 to 145 degrees adding water if the sauce becomes too thick.  Can I use other types of apples?: Yes but the flavor of the sauce and the texture of the cooked apples will vary depending on the apples you choose. Apples that turn very soft when cooked such as Red Delicious and McIntosh may turn into applesauce.  Do I need to alter the recipe for a 6-quart electric pressure cooker? Yes bring the pot to low pressure (not high) then immediately turn the cooker off and let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes; do not let the cooker switch to the warm setting. Use the browning (not the simmer) setting to simmer the apple mixture.  Tips: The only prep the tenderloin requires before cooking is to remove the sinewy silverskin which turns unpleasantly chewy once cooked. To remove it slip a boning knife underneath the silverskin angle the blade slightly upward and use gentle back-and-forth motion to remove it from the tenderloin.  Since this cut of meat is so small and lean it does 
Grilled Country Pork Chops with Bourbon-Basted Grilled Peaches,Eating Local: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Janet Fletcher photography by Sara Remington,home/recipes/main-courses/meat/Grilled Country Pork Chops with Bourbon-Basted Grilled Peaches,4 servings,Brine 1 1/2 quarts water 6 tablespoons kosher or sea salt 1 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper Handful of thyme sprigs 2 cloves garlic peeled and smashed with the side of a chef's knife  4 bone-in pork loin chops about  3/4 inch thick 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons bourbon 2 teaspoons honey 2 large freestone peaches (such as O'Henry or Elberta) halved and pitted   ,Grilling gives peaches and other stone fruits a flavor boost bringing their natural sugar to the fore. Use freestone peaches so that you can easily twist the halves off the pit. Baste them with butter honey and bourbon as they grill to give them a sheen then serve with a juicy pork chop brined for a full day to season it all the way through.  To make the brine in a medium saucepan combine all the ingredients. Bring to a boil over high heat stirring to dissolve the salt. Set aside until completely cool.  Put the pork chops in a container that holds them snugly in a single layer. Add the brine which should cover them. Cover with plastic wrap. Alternatively you can put the port and its brine in a 1-gallon heavy-duty resealable food storage bag. Refrigerate for 24 hours.  About 1 hour before cooking remove the pork chops from the brine and set them on a wire cooling rack at room temperature to dry.  Prepare a moderate charcoal fire for indirect grilling or preheat a gas grill to medium (375 degrees F) leaving one burner unlit.  Combine the butter bourbon and honey in a small saucepan. Set over moderately low heat stirring until the butter melts and the honey dissolves. Keep warm.  Pat the pork chops with paper towels to remove any remaining surface moisture. Set the chops directly over the coals or gas flame and brown on both sides turning once for about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to indirect heat cover the grill and cook until the chops offer some resistance to the touch but are still springy not firm about 4 minutes longer. If you are unsure of doneness measure the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer inserting it horizontally into a chop; it should register about 150 degrees F for medium.  Once you have moved the pork chops to indirect heat you can grill the peaches. Brush them all over with the butter-honey mixture and place cut side down directly over the coals or gas flame. Cook until they are nicely charred then turn baste again and cook just until they are tender and juicy. The pork chops and peaches should be done at roughly the same time but if not move whichever is done first to a cooler area of the grill to wait. Serve each pork chop with a grilled peach half alongside.

Green Chile Tamales,Cuisinart,home/recipes/main-courses/poultry/Green Chile Tamales,24 tamales,Green Chile: 2 pounds poblano peppers 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion peeled and finely chopped 1 jalapeno pepper seeded and finely chopped 4 garlic cloves finely chopped 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon unbleached all-purpose flour 2 cups chicken broth low sodium 2 pounds whole chicken legs (about 4 legs) roasted meat removed and shredded 24 corn husks  Masa Dough: 5 cups masa harina 3 3/4 cups water 1 3/4 cups vegetable oil 1 tablespoon plus one teaspoon baking powder 2 1/2 teaspoons sea or kosher salt 2 quarts water for steaming  ,Prepare the green chile: Line the cooking pot of the Multicooker with the poblano peppers. Cover and set to Brown/Saute at 400 degrees F. Cook for about 30 minutes removing cover to turn every 8 to 10 minutes until all sides are charred (time will vary depending on the size and quantity of the peppers). Remove put into a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Once cool to the touch peel seed and roughly chop. Reserve. Carefully clean any of the char from the bottom of the pot before using for the next step.  Put oil into the cooking pot and again set to Brown/Saute at 400 degrees F. When the oil is hot add the onion jalapeno and garlic to the pot. Stir and saute until softened and slightly golden. Stir in the flour and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the broth using a nonstick whisk and bring to simmer until smooth and thickened (about 5 to 7 minutes). Stir in the chicken and the reserved chopped poblanos and switch to Slow Cook on High for 3 hours.  While the chile is cooking pour boiling water over the corn husks to soak. Use an inverted plate to keep the husks submerged for up to 1 hour.  Remove the finished chile from the cooking pot. It should be moist not soupy. If necessary transfer to a strainer to remove any excess liquid. Allow cooking pot to cool enough to handle and clean. Replace in the unit to steam tamales.   Prepare the masa: In a large bowl using a hand mixer mix together the masa water oil baking powder and salt.  Assemble tamales: Drain and rinse corn husks and lay flat. Hold one in your hand and spread about  3/4 cup of masa dough onto the husk. You want to cover 2/3 of the husk toward the wider end. Place about 2 to 4 tablespoons of chile on top of the masa (this will differ depending on the size of the corn husks). Fold the narrow end of the husk up into the tamale and then roll the sides together to enclose.   Repeat with remaining tamales  Fill multicooker pot with 2 quarts of water and set the unit to Steam fitted with the steaming rack. Place 12 of the tamales onto the rack and set timer to 1 1/2 hours. Check after 1 hour has passed – the husk should easily peel away from the side and the masa should be set. Repeat this step making sure that there are 2 quarts of water in the cooking pot and steam the remaining tamales.  Note:Masa harina is flour made from the dried corn dough used to make tortillas and can be found in specialty food stores or in the international aisle of most supermarkets.

Classic Swiss Fondue with Crudite,Sur La Table,home/recipes/appetizers/dips-spreads-sauces-seasonings/Classic Swiss Fondue with Crudite,6 servings as an appetizer or part of a multicourse meal, style="color:#000000">Fondue:  1 garlic clove cut in half 1 cup dry white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio plus more as needed 1/2 pound Emmentaler cheese grated 1/2 pound Gruy&egrave;re cheese grated 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  1 tablespoon kirsch (optional) Sea salt and freshly ground white or black pepper  Crudite for dipping:  1 baguette warmed in the oven and cut into 1-inch cubes  2 large sweet-tart apples cored and cut into 1-inch cubes  1 pound assorted raw vegetables such as broccoli cauliflower cherry tomatoes and carrots ,Fondue can be made start to finish at the table with guests taking part in the whole process. To make ahead use a double boiler to prepare fondue that is ready to go when guests arrive!  1. Rub the cut side of the garlic clove around the inside of a fondue pot or around the inside of a bowl set over a double boiler if using (do not allow the bottom of the bowl to come into direct contact with the water). Add wine and heat until steaming.   2. Working over medium-low heat add cheese 1 handful at a time to the wine stirring until almost melted before adding next handful. Continue until all cheese is melted into the wine forming a smooth glossy melted cheese sauce about 10 minutes. (It's important that the fondue stay below a simmer under 150 degrees F once you start adding the cheese or the cheese may separate.) Once all the cheese is incorporated stir in lemon juice and kirsch. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.   3. To serve: If not already in a fondue pot transfer fondue to a fondue pot to keep warm and melted at the table. Arrange bread apples and blanched vegetables on a platter for dipping. Have fondue forks or bamboo skewers available for dipping as well as small individual plates and extra silverware for each guest. If fondue begins to thicken too much at the table add small amounts of wine and stir to loosen it.  
Chili Honey Grilled Cheese,Karlee Flores,home/recipes/sandwiches/Chili Honey Grilled Cheese,1 serving,12 slices of bread I prefer buttermilk or nut ¼ cup butter ¼ cup bacon grease ¾ cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons chili garlic sauce 2 tablespoons honey 16 ounces shredded cheddar cheese   ,In a medium bowl mix the butter and bacon grease together until smooth. In a separate bowl whisk the mayonnaise chili garlic sauce and honey together until well combined. To assemble take two pieces of bread and spread the chili honey sauce on each slice. On one slice of bread sprinkle on about 1/3 to ½ cup of the shredded cheddar cheese (depending on the size of bread). Sandwich together with the remaining slice and spread the bacon butter in an even layer on the top of the sandwich. Place a non-stick skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Place the sandwich on the skillet bacon butter side down. Spread the bacon butter onto the other side of the sandwich. Let cook until golden brown about 3-5 minutes. Flip and cook for another 3-5 minutes until golden brown and the cheese and melty. Serve immediately and enjoy!

Shrimp Rosemary -"Spiedini Alla Romagna",Mario Batali Italian Grill,home/recipes/appetizers/hot/Shrimp Rosemary -"Spiedini Alla Romagna",6 servings,1 bunch Italian parsley leaves only (about 2 cups loosely packed) 1 bunch basil leaves only (about 2 cups packed) 2 cups fresh bread crumbs  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper to taste  3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 pounds large shrimp (21-30 per pound) peeled and deveined 12 large rosemary sprigs prepared as skewers and soaked in water for at least 2 hours or overnight 2 lemons cut into wedges   ,It's easy to make skewers from rosemary sprigs.  Choose large sturdy sprigs that are about 8 inches long.  Pull off most of the leaves from each sprig leaving a nice tuft of leaves at the top (use the remaining leaves in the dish you are making or reserve for another use).  Using a sharp knife cut off the bottom of the sprig on a diagonal to give you a sharp point.  The skewer will slide easily through the shrimp when you skewer them.  Toss the parsley and basil leaves into a food processor add the breadcrumbs salt pepper and  3/4 cup of the olive oil and zap until the herbs are chopped and the bread crumbs look green.  Transfer to a pie plate or wide shallow bowl add the shrimp and toss to coat well.  Skewer 4 or 5 shrimp on each rosemary sprig (the easiest way to do this is line up 4 or 5 shrimp at a time on a work surface and run a skewer through them; then separate them slightly so they will cook evenly).  Dredge on both sides in the bread crumb mixture place on a platter and put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Preheat a gas grill or prepare a fire in a charcoal grill.  Put a piastra on the grill to preheat.  Spritz or brush the piastra with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Place the skewers on the piastra and cook turning once just until the shrimp are opaque throughout and some of the crumbs are browned 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a serving platter and serve with the lemon wedges.   
Rich Breakfast Dough,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/dough/Rich Breakfast Dough,about 1 1/2 pounds, 1/2 cup (4 ounces) warm whole milk (110 degrees  to 115 degrees F)  3/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast or 1 1/8 teaspoons instant yeast 1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk at room temperature 2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces) bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter very soft (not melted)   ,A leaner version of brioche dough this can be used for all those wonderful yeasted breakfast breads you love like sticky buns and coffee cake. Classic brioche while delicious is unnecessarily rich when paired with flavor-packed fillings and toppings. Despite the reduced amount of eggs and butter this dough is still soft and easy to work with and it bakes into a tender flavorful partner for all manner of fillings both sweet and savory.  Mix and knead the dough: Combine the warm milk and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Whisk by hand to blend well. Let the mixture sit for 5 to 10 minutes until the yeast is activated and foamy or bubbling. Add the egg and yolk and whisk by hand until well blended. Stir in the flour and salt with a silicone or rubber spatula. Attach the dough hook and knead on low speed for 2 minutes. The dough may look ragged at this point but don't worry-the addition of butter will smooth it out. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 1 minute. With the mixer running add the soft butter 1 tablespoon at a time allowing each addition to blend in before adding the next. Once all the butter has been added decrease the speed to medium-low and continue to knead for 5 to 6 minutes longer until the dough looks soft and silky.  Rise the dough (first rise): Lightly butter or oil the tub or bowl scrape the dough into the tub and brush the surface of the dough with a little butter or oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cotton towel and let the dough rise until doubled 1 to 1 1/2 hours. If you are using a tub be sure to mark the starting level of the dough with a pencil or piece of tape so it's easy to tell when the dough has doubled. At this point the dough is ready to be punched down and used in your recipe of choice.  Storing: The dough can be punched down and refrigerated overnight.

Chocolate Banana Marble Bread,The Art & Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing recipes by Cindy Mushet photography by Maren Caruso,home/recipes/breads/quick-breads-biscuits/Chocolate Banana Marble Bread,1 loaf,2 large or 3 medium very ripe bananas at room temperature  3/4 cup (2 ounces) buttermilk at room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 cups (7 ounces) sifted cake flour 1 teaspoon baking soda  3/4 teaspoon baking powder  3/4 cup (1 ounce) unsifted unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) boiling water plus more if needed 1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter softened (65 degrees  to 68 degrees F) 1 cup (7 ounces) sugar 2 large eggs at room temperature lightly beaten   ,Here's a banana bread that's soft tender and bursting with bananas yet not overly sweet as so many versions are. The key is an intensely bitter cocoa-powder paste added to half of the batter resulting in a deep rich chocolate flavor that pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the bananas. The two batters are marbled together producing a beautiful pattern and adding a sophisticated note to this all-American favorite. Because of the moisture that the bananas add the loaf keeps well for at least 4 to 5 days at room temperature and it freezes so well that you can put a couple of them away for unexpected visitors. Be sure the bananas are ripe and soft with plenty of black spots speckling their skins or you won't have the burst of banana flavor you want. Whirl them in the food processor for an ultra-smooth puree or mash thoroughly with a fork if you prefer.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat the loaf pan with melted butter or high-heat canola oil spray and line it with a piece of parchment paper that extends 1 inch beyond the long edge of both sides of the pan. Peel the bananas and place them in the bowl of the food processor. Process to a smooth puree. (Alternately mash them in a bowl using a fork.) Measure out 1 cup of the puree and transfer it to a medium bowl discarding the rest of the puree or saving it for another use. Add the buttermilk and vanilla and whisk just until blended. Set aside.  Use a fine-mesh strainer to sift the cake flour baking soda and baking powder together into a medium bowl. Whisk to blend well. Set aside. Place the cocoa powder in the small bowl. Pour the boiling water over the cocoa and stir until it forms a smooth paste-it should run thickly off the spoon. If it is too thick add another tablespoon of boiling water and stir again. Set aside.  Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer. Beat on medium-high speed until the butter is very light almost white in color 4 to 5 minutes. Scrape down the bowl with a spatula. Turn the mixer to medium speed and add the eggs 1 tablespoon at a time completely blending in each addition before adding the next. About halfway through the eggs turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl with the spatula then continue adding the rest of the eggs. Scrape down the bowl again.  With the mixer running on the lowest speed add one-third of the flour mixture. Just as it is barely blended and you can still see a few patches of flour add half the banana mixture. Repeat with the remaining flour and banana mixtures ending with the flour. Scrape down the bowl and finish blending the batter by hand.  Transfer half of the batter to the second medium bowl. Add the cocoa paste and using the rubber spatula gently but thoroughly blend it into the batter.  Drop alternating spoonfuls of dark and light batters into the prepared pan then marbleize by using a spoon to gently turn the batter over in 3 places down the length of the pan.  Bake the banana bread for 55 to 65 minutes until firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. When cool remove from the pan peel off the parchment paper and cut slices by sawing gently with a serrated knife.

Dehydrated Apples,Breville,home/recipes/breakfast/fruit-vegetables/Dehydrated Apples,1 serving,Apples   , Prep time: 20minutes Dehydrate time 8-10hrs   Thoroughly rinse apples then cut into very thin slices (0.03 -0.05 inches /1-1.5mm).  Plunge slices into a bowl with lemon juice. Dry apple slices on paper towel. Lay slices in a single layer on the dehydrator basket.  Select DEHYDRATE/super convection/125F. Press SELECT button to activate ROTATE REMINDER. Slide in basket with the apple slices and press START. Dehydrate for 8-10hours or until dehydrated to your liking. Rotate tray(s) when prompted by the beep of the ROTATE REMIND.   Note:  Firmer apples are best for apple slices.  Lemon juice keeps the apple from browning too much while dehydrating.  The sweeter the apples the more pliable the dehydrated product will be because of the elevated sugar content.

Autumn Leaf Apple-Cranberry Pie,Recipe developed for Sur La Table's Cooking Classes,home/recipes/desserts/pies-pastries-tarts/Autumn Leaf Apple-Cranberry Pie,1 (9- or 10-inch) pie,2 recipes Flaky Pie Dough (recipe attached)  3 3/4 pounds (about 8 medium) crisp-tart apples such as Granny Smith Gala Honeycrisp or Fuji peeled cored and cut into  3/4-inch thick slices 10 ounces fresh cranberries (about 2 1/2 cups) roughly chopped in a food processor    1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar  3/4 cup granulated sugar plus more for dusting crust      1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg  1/8 teaspoon ground allspice  1/8 teaspoon ground cloves   1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt  2 tablespoons cornstarch  1 large egg  1 tablespoon milk  Good-quality vanilla ice cream for serving   ,When choosing baking apples look for firm sturdy apples that will hold their shape in the oven. Otherwise you'll end up with applesauce pie.  Tart Granny Smiths are reliable and available in every market in the country but try seeking out local varieties at the farmers' market or roadside stands during apple season. Don't be afraid to mix and match apples. A few tart and sturdy ones with a few sweet can be a great combination.   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and place a baking sheet on the rack.   To prepare filling: In a large bowl gently toss apples and chopped cranberries with brown sugar granulated sugar lemon juice spices salt and cornstarch until evenly coated. Transfer mixture to a large skillet or Dutch oven. Cook apples over medium-high heat until juices are very thick and apples are crisp-tender about 7 minutes. Remove filling from heat set aside to cool completely. (This filling can be made up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated.)   To prepare pie shell: Lightly flour a work surface. Place one recipe of pastry dough and dust a little flour on top. Roll out the dough into a 14-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over pie dish and carefully unroll the round over the dish easing it into the bottom and sides and allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Trim the dough so that it overhangs by 1-inch. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.   Lightly flour work surface place the remaining pastry dough in the center and dust a little flour on top. Roll out the dough into a 14-inch round about  1/8-inch thick. Use decorative pastry cutters or mini cookie cutters to make 3 or 4 cuts around the center of the dough to form the vents keep the pastry cutouts set aside.    Fill chilled pie shell with the cooled filling. Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin center the pin over the pie dish and carefully unroll the dough to cover the top. Trim the top crust flush with the rim and decoratively crimp the edges. (Chill pie while rolling out any remaining dough scraps to make additional decorative cutouts optional.)     In a small bowl beat the egg with the milk to create an egg wash and use a pastry brush to lightly glaze the surface of the pie. Arrange your decorative cutouts on the top of the pie crust and brush with egg wash. Lightly dust pie with granulated sugar. Bake pie for 60 minutes or until the crust is a lovely golden brown and the apples are bubbling. (Plan on an additional 20 minutes of baking time if the pie filling has been made ahead and refrigerated).  Halfway through baking cover crust with foil or pie crust shield. Transfer pie to a cooling rack and let cool for at least one hour. Serve warm or at room temperature with a scoop of ice cream.   Plan Your Baking Time:  Don't forget that pies have long bake times and often cook at different oven temperatures. Assemble and bake pies the night before or early morning on Thanksgiving Day before your oven is packed with the rest of your holiday dishes. This way the pies have ample time to bake and cool before things really start to heat up in the kitchen.     Getting Ahead: You can make the pie crust 2 days ahead and keep it chilled and covered. You can prepare and cook the apple-cranberry filling up to 3 days in advance.   Storing: The pie will keep at room temperature under a cake dome for up to 2 days. For longer storage cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Reheat in a 375 degrees F oven for 15 to 20 minutes to warm the filling and re-crisp the crust.
